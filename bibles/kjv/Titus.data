Titus1:1 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
Titus1:2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
Titus1:3 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
Titus1:4 To Titus, <em>mine</em> own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, <em>and</em> peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
Titus1:5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
Titus1:6 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
Titus1:7 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
Titus1:8 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
Titus1:9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
Titus1:10 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
Titus1:11 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.
Titus1:12 One of themselves, <em>even</em> a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians <em>are</em> alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.
Titus1:13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
Titus1:14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
Titus1:15 Unto the pure all things <em>are</em> pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving <em>is</em> nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
Titus1:16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny <em>him</em>, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
Titus2:1 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
Titus2:2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.
Titus2:3 The aged women likewise, that <em>they be</em> in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
Titus2:4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,
Titus2:5 <em>To be</em> discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
Titus2:6 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
Titus2:7 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine <em>shewing</em> uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
Titus2:8 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
Titus2:9 <em>Exhort</em> servants to be obedient unto their own masters, <em>and</em> to please <em>them</em> well in all <em>things</em>; not answering again;
Titus2:10 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
Titus2:11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
Titus2:12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;
Titus2:13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
Titus2:14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
Titus2:15 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
Titus3:1 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,
Titus3:2 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, <em>but</em> gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.
Titus3:3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, <em>and</em> hating one another.
Titus3:4 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,
Titus3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
Titus3:6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
Titus3:7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
Titus3:8 <em>This is</em> a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.
Titus3:9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
Titus3:10 A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;
Titus3:11 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.
Titus3:12 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.
Titus3:13 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
Titus3:14 And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
Titus3:15 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace <em>be</em> with you all. Amen. <<(It was written to Titus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.)>>
