Prv1:1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
Prv1:2 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
Prv1:3 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
Prv1:4 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
Prv1:5 A wise <em>man</em> will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
Prv1:6 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
Prv1:7 The fear of the LORD <em>is</em> the beginning of knowledge: <em>but</em> fools despise wisdom and instruction.
Prv1:8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
Prv1:9 For they <em>shall be</em> an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.
Prv1:10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
Prv1:11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:
Prv1:12 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
Prv1:13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
Prv1:14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:
Prv1:15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:
Prv1:16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
Prv1:17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
Prv1:18 And they lay wait for their <em>own</em> blood; they lurk privily for their <em>own</em> lives.
Prv1:19 So <em>are</em> the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; <em>which</em> taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
Prv1:20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:
Prv1:21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, <em>saying</em>,
Prv1:22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
Prv1:23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
Prv1:24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
Prv1:25 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
Prv1:26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
Prv1:27 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
Prv1:28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
Prv1:29 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
Prv1:30 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
Prv1:31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
Prv1:32 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
Prv1:33 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
Prv2:1 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;
Prv2:2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, <em>and</em> apply thine heart to understanding;
Prv2:3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, <em>and</em> liftest up thy voice for understanding;
Prv2:4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as <em>for</em> hid treasures;
Prv2:5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.
Prv2:6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth <em>cometh</em> knowledge and understanding.
Prv2:7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: <em>he is</em> a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
Prv2:8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.
Prv2:9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; <em>yea</em>, every good path.
Prv2:10 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;
Prv2:11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:
Prv2:12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil <em>man</em>, from the man that speaketh froward things;
Prv2:13 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
Prv2:14 Who rejoice to do evil, <em>and</em> delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
Prv2:15 Whose ways <em>are</em> crooked, and <em>they</em> froward in their paths:
Prv2:16 To deliver thee from the strange woman, <em>even</em> from the stranger <em>which</em> flattereth with her words;
Prv2:17 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.
Prv2:18 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.
Prv2:19 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.
Prv2:20 That thou mayest walk in the way of good <em>men</em>, and keep the paths of the righteous.
Prv2:21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
Prv2:22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
Prv3:1 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:
Prv3:2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
Prv3:3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:
Prv3:4 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
Prv3:5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
Prv3:6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
Prv3:7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.
Prv3:8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.
Prv3:9 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:
Prv3:10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
Prv3:11 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:
Prv3:12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son <em>in whom</em> he delighteth.
Prv3:13 Happy <em>is</em> the man <em>that</em> findeth wisdom, and the man <em>that</em> getteth understanding.
Prv3:14 For the merchandise of it <em>is</em> better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
Prv3:15 She <em>is</em> more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
Prv3:16 Length of days <em>is</em> in her right hand; <em>and</em> in her left hand riches and honour.
Prv3:17 Her ways <em>are</em> ways of pleasantness, and all her paths <em>are</em> peace.
Prv3:18 She <em>is</em> a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy <em>is every one</em> that retaineth her.
Prv3:19 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.
Prv3:20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.
Prv3:21 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:
Prv3:22 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.
Prv3:23 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
Prv3:24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
Prv3:25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
Prv3:26 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.
Prv3:27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do <em>it</em>.
Prv3:28 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.
Prv3:29 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
Prv3:30 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
Prv3:31 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
Prv3:32 For the froward <em>is</em> abomination to the LORD: but his secret <em>is</em> with the righteous.
Prv3:33 The curse of the LORD <em>is</em> in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.
Prv3:34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.
Prv3:35 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
Prv4:1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
Prv4:2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.
Prv4:3 For I was my father's son, tender and only <em>beloved</em> in the sight of my mother.
Prv4:4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.
Prv4:5 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget <em>it</em> not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.
Prv4:6 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.
Prv4:7 Wisdom <em>is</em> the principal thing; <em>therefore</em> get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.
Prv4:8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.
Prv4:9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
Prv4:10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.
Prv4:11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.
Prv4:12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
Prv4:13 Take fast hold of instruction; let <em>her</em> not go: keep her; for she <em>is</em> thy life.
Prv4:14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil <em>men</em>.
Prv4:15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
Prv4:16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause <em>some</em> to fall.
Prv4:17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
Prv4:18 But the path of the just <em>is</em> as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
Prv4:19 The way of the wicked <em>is</em> as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.
Prv4:20 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.
Prv4:21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.
Prv4:22 For they <em>are</em> life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.
Prv4:23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it <em>are</em> the issues of life.
Prv4:24 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.
Prv4:25 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
Prv4:26 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
Prv4:27 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.
Prv5:1 My son, attend unto my wisdom, <em>and</em> bow thine ear to my understanding:
Prv5:2 That thou mayest regard discretion, and <em>that</em> thy lips may keep knowledge.
Prv5:3 For the lips of a strange woman drop <em>as</em> an honeycomb, and her mouth <em>is</em> smoother than oil:
Prv5:4 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.
Prv5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
Prv5:6 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, <em>that</em> thou canst not know <em>them</em>.
Prv5:7 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
Prv5:8 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:
Prv5:9 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:
Prv5:10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours <em>be</em> in the house of a stranger;
Prv5:11 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
Prv5:12 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
Prv5:13 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
Prv5:14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
Prv5:15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.
Prv5:16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, <em>and</em> rivers of waters in the streets.
Prv5:17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.
Prv5:18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
Prv5:19 <em>Let her be as</em> the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
Prv5:20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
Prv5:21 For the ways of man <em>are</em> before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.
Prv5:22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
Prv5:23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
Prv6:1 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, <em>if</em> thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
Prv6:2 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
Prv6:3 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
Prv6:4 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
Prv6:5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand <em>of the hunter</em>, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
Prv6:6 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
Prv6:7 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
Prv6:8 Provideth her meat in the summer, <em>and</em> gathereth her food in the harvest.
Prv6:9 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
Prv6:10 <em>Yet</em> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
Prv6:11 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.
Prv6:12 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.
Prv6:13 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
Prv6:14 Frowardness <em>is</em> in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.
Prv6:15 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
Prv6:16 These six <em>things</em> doth the LORD hate: yea, seven <em>are</em> an abomination unto him:
Prv6:17 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
Prv6:18 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
Prv6:19 A false witness <em>that</em> speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.
Prv6:20 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
Prv6:21 Bind them continually upon thine heart, <em>and</em> tie them about thy neck.
Prv6:22 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and <em>when</em> thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
Prv6:23 For the commandment <em>is</em> a lamp; and the law <em>is</em> light; and reproofs of instruction <em>are</em> the way of life:
Prv6:24 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
Prv6:25 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
Prv6:26 For by means of a whorish woman <em>a man is brought</em> to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.
Prv6:27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
Prv6:28 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
Prv6:29 So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
Prv6:30 <em>Men</em> do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
Prv6:31 But <em>if</em> he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
Prv6:32 <em>But</em> whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he <em>that</em> doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
Prv6:33 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
Prv6:34 For jealousy <em>is</em> the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
Prv6:35 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
Prv7:1 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
Prv7:2 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.
Prv7:3 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.
Prv7:4 Say unto wisdom, Thou <em>art</em> my sister; and call understanding <em>thy</em> kinswoman:
Prv7:5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger <em>which</em> flattereth with her words.
Prv7:6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
Prv7:7 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
Prv7:8 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
Prv7:9 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
Prv7:10 And, behold, there met him a woman <em>with</em> the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.
Prv7:11 (She <em>is</em> loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
Prv7:12 Now <em>is she</em> without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)
Prv7:13 So she caught him, and kissed him, <em>and</em> with an impudent face said unto him,
Prv7:14 <em>I have</em> peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.
Prv7:15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
Prv7:16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved <em>works</em>, with fine linen of Egypt.
Prv7:17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Prv7:18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.
Prv7:19 For the goodman <em>is</em> not at home, he is gone a long journey:
Prv7:20 He hath taken a bag of money with him, <em>and</em> will come home at the day appointed.
Prv7:21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
Prv7:22 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
Prv7:23 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it <em>is</em> for his life.
Prv7:24 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
Prv7:25 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
Prv7:26 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong <em>men</em> have been slain by her.
Prv7:27 Her house <em>is</em> the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
Prv8:1 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?
Prv8:2 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.
Prv8:3 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.
Prv8:4 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice <em>is</em> to the sons of man.
Prv8:5 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.
Prv8:6 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips <em>shall be</em> right things.
Prv8:7 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness <em>is</em> an abomination to my lips.
Prv8:8 All the words of my mouth <em>are</em> in righteousness; <em>there is</em> nothing froward or perverse in them.
Prv8:9 They <em>are</em> all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.
Prv8:10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.
Prv8:11 For wisdom <em>is</em> better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
Prv8:12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.
Prv8:13 The fear of the LORD <em>is</em> to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.
Prv8:14 Counsel <em>is</em> mine, and sound wisdom: I <em>am</em> understanding; I have strength.
Prv8:15 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
Prv8:16 By me princes rule, and nobles, <em>even</em> all the judges of the earth.
Prv8:17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.
Prv8:18 Riches and honour <em>are</em> with me; <em>yea</em>, durable riches and righteousness.
Prv8:19 My fruit <em>is</em> better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
Prv8:20 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:
Prv8:21 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
Prv8:22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
Prv8:23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
Prv8:24 When <em>there were</em> no depths, I was brought forth; when <em>there were</em> no fountains abounding with water.
Prv8:25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:
Prv8:26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
Prv8:27 When he prepared the heavens, I <em>was</em> there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:
Prv8:28 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
Prv8:29 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
Prv8:30 Then I was by him, <em>as</em> one brought up <em>with him</em>: and I was daily <em>his</em> delight, rejoicing always before him;
Prv8:31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights <em>were</em> with the sons of men.
Prv8:32 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed <em>are they that</em> keep my ways.
Prv8:33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
Prv8:34 Blessed <em>is</em> the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
Prv8:35 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.
Prv8:36 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
Prv9:1 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:
Prv9:2 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.
Prv9:3 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,
Prv9:4 Whoso <em>is</em> simple, let him turn in hither: <em>as for</em> him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
Prv9:5 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine <em>which</em> I have mingled.
Prv9:6 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
Prv9:7 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked <em>man getteth</em> himself a blot.
Prv9:8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
Prv9:9 Give <em>instruction</em> to a wise <em>man</em>, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just <em>man</em>, and he will increase in learning.
Prv9:10 The fear of the LORD <em>is</em> the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy <em>is</em> understanding.
Prv9:11 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
Prv9:12 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but <em>if</em> thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear <em>it</em>.
Prv9:13 A foolish woman <em>is</em> clamorous: <em>she is</em> simple, and knoweth nothing.
Prv9:14 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
Prv9:15 To call passengers who go right on their ways:
Prv9:16 Whoso <em>is</em> simple, let him turn in hither: and <em>as for</em> him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
Prv9:17 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread <em>eaten</em> in secret is pleasant.
Prv9:18 But he knoweth not that the dead <em>are</em> there; <em>and that</em> her guests <em>are</em> in the depths of hell.
Prv10:1 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son <em>is</em> the heaviness of his mother.
Prv10:2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.
Prv10:3 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.
Prv10:4 He becometh poor that dealeth <em>with</em> a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.
Prv10:5 He that gathereth in summer <em>is</em> a wise son: <em>but</em> he that sleepeth in harvest <em>is</em> a son that causeth shame.
Prv10:6 Blessings <em>are</em> upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
Prv10:7 The memory of the just <em>is</em> blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.
Prv10:8 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.
Prv10:9 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.
Prv10:10 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.
Prv10:11 The mouth of a righteous <em>man is</em> a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
Prv10:12 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.
Prv10:13 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod <em>is</em> for the back of him that is void of understanding.
Prv10:14 Wise <em>men</em> lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish <em>is</em> near destruction.
Prv10:15 The rich man's wealth <em>is</em> his strong city: the destruction of the poor <em>is</em> their poverty.
Prv10:16 The labour of the righteous <em>tendeth</em> to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.
Prv10:17 He <em>is in</em> the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.
Prv10:18 He that hideth hatred <em>with</em> lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, <em>is</em> a fool.
Prv10:19 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips <em>is</em> wise.
Prv10:20 The tongue of the just <em>is as</em> choice silver: the heart of the wicked <em>is</em> little worth.
Prv10:21 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.
Prv10:22 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.
Prv10:23 <em>It is</em> as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.
Prv10:24 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.
Prv10:25 As the whirlwind passeth, so <em>is</em> the wicked no <em>more</em>: but the righteous <em>is</em> an everlasting foundation.
Prv10:26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so <em>is</em> the sluggard to them that send him.
Prv10:27 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
Prv10:28 The hope of the righteous <em>shall be</em> gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.
Prv10:29 The way of the LORD <em>is</em> strength to the upright: but destruction <em>shall be</em> to the workers of iniquity.

Prv11:23 The desire of the righteous <em>is</em> only good: <em>but</em> the expectation of the wicked <em>is</em> wrath.
Prv11:24 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and <em>there is</em> that withholdeth more than is meet, but <em>it tendeth</em> to poverty.
Prv11:25 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.
Prv11:26 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing <em>shall be</em> upon the head of him that selleth <em>it</em>.

Prv14:29 <em>He that is</em> slow to wrath <em>is</em> of great understanding: but <em>he that is</em> hasty of spirit exalteth folly.
Prv14:30 A sound heart <em>is</em> the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.
Prv14:31 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.
Prv14:32 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

Prv15:15 All the days of the afflicted <em>are</em> evil: but he that is of a merry heart <em>hath</em> a continual feast.
Prv15:16 Better <em>is</em> little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.
Prv15:17 Better <em>is</em> a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.
Prv15:18 A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but <em>he that is</em> slow to anger appeaseth strife.
Prv15:19 The way of the slothful <em>man is</em> as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous <em>is</em> made plain.
Prv15:20 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.
Prv15:21 Folly <em>is</em> joy to <em>him that is</em> destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.
Prv15:22 Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellers they are established.
Prv15:23 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word <em>spoken</em> in due season, how good <em>is it</em>!
Prv15:24 The way of life <em>is</em> above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.
Prv15:25 The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow.
Prv15:26 The thoughts of the wicked <em>are</em> an abomination to the LORD: but <em>the words</em> of the pure <em>are</em> pleasant words.

Prv15:30 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: <em>and</em> a good report maketh the bones fat.
Prv15:31 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.
Prv15:32 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.
Prv15:33 The fear of the LORD <em>is</em> the instruction of wisdom; and before honour <em>is</em> humility.
Prv16:1 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, <em>is</em> from the LORD.
Prv16:2 All the ways of a man <em>are</em> clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.
Prv16:3 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.
Prv16:4 The LORD hath made all <em>things</em> for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.
Prv16:5 Every one <em>that is</em> proud in heart <em>is</em> an abomination to the LORD: <em>though</em> hand <em>join</em> in hand, he shall not be unpunished.

Prv16:9 A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.
Prv16:10 A divine sentence <em>is</em> in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.
Prv16:11 A just weight and balance <em>are</em> the LORD's: all the weights of the bag <em>are</em> his work.
Prv16:12 <em>It is</em> an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.
Prv16:13 Righteous lips <em>are</em> the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.
Prv16:14 The wrath of a king <em>is as</em> messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.
Prv16:15 In the light of the king's countenance <em>is</em> life; and his favour <em>is</em> as a cloud of the latter rain.
Prv16:16 How much better <em>is it</em> to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!
Prv16:17 The highway of the upright <em>is</em> to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.
Prv16:18 Pride <em>goeth</em> before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.
Prv16:19 Better <em>it is to be</em> of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.
Prv16:20 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy <em>is</em> he.
Prv16:21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.
Prv16:22 Understanding <em>is</em> a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools <em>is</em> folly.
Prv16:23 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.
Prv16:24 Pleasant words <em>are as</em> an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
Prv16:25 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof <em>are</em> the ways of death.
Prv16:26 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.
Prv16:27 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips <em>there is</em> as a burning fire.
Prv16:28 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.
Prv16:29 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way <em>that is</em> not good.
Prv16:30 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.
Prv16:31 The hoary head <em>is</em> a crown of glory, <em>if</em> it be found in the way of righteousness.
Prv16:32 <em>He that is</em> slow to anger <em>is</em> better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
Prv16:33 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof <em>is</em> of the LORD.
Prv17:1 Better <em>is</em> a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices <em>with</em> strife.
Prv17:2 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.
Prv17:3 The fining pot <em>is</em> for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.
Prv17:4 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; <em>and</em> a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.
Prv17:5 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: <em>and</em> he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.
Prv17:6 Children's children <em>are</em> the crown of old men; and the glory of children <em>are</em> their fathers.
Prv17:7 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.
Prv17:8 A gift <em>is as</em> a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
Prv17:9 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth <em>very</em> friends.
Prv17:10 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.
Prv17:11 An evil <em>man</em> seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
Prv17:12 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.
Prv17:13 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.
Prv17:14 The beginning of strife <em>is as</em> when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.
Prv17:15 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both <em>are</em> abomination to the LORD.
Prv17:16 Wherefore <em>is there</em> a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing <em>he hath</em> no heart <em>to it</em>?
Prv17:17 A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.
Prv17:18 A man void of understanding striketh hands, <em>and</em> becometh surety in the presence of his friend.
Prv17:19 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: <em>and</em> he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.
Prv17:20 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.
Prv17:21 He that begetteth a fool <em>doeth it</em> to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.
Prv17:22 A merry heart doeth good <em>like</em> a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.
Prv17:23 A wicked <em>man</em> taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.
Prv17:24 Wisdom <em>is</em> before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool <em>are</em> in the ends of the earth.
Prv17:25 A foolish son <em>is</em> a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.
Prv17:26 Also to punish the just <em>is</em> not good, <em>nor</em> to strike princes for equity.
Prv17:27 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: <em>and</em> a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.
Prv17:28 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: <em>and</em> he that shutteth his lips <em>is esteemed</em> a man of understanding.
Prv18:1 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh <em>and</em> intermeddleth with all wisdom.
Prv18:2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.
Prv18:3 When the wicked cometh, <em>then</em> cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.
Prv18:4 The words of a man's mouth <em>are as</em> deep waters, <em>and</em> the wellspring of wisdom <em>as</em> a flowing brook.
Prv18:5 <em>It is</em> not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.
Prv18:6 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.
Prv18:7 A fool's mouth <em>is</em> his destruction, and his lips <em>are</em> the snare of his soul.
Prv18:8 The words of a talebearer <em>are</em> as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
Prv18:9 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.
Prv18:10 The name of the LORD <em>is</em> a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.
Prv18:11 The rich man's wealth <em>is</em> his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.
Prv18:12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour <em>is</em> humility.
Prv18:13 He that answereth a matter before he heareth <em>it</em>, it <em>is</em> folly and shame unto him.
Prv18:14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?
Prv18:15 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
Prv18:16 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.
Prv18:17 <em>He that is</em> first in his own cause <em>seemeth</em> just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.
Prv18:18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.
Prv18:19 A brother offended <em>is harder to be won</em> than a strong city: and <em>their</em> contentions <em>are</em> like the bars of a castle.
Prv18:20 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; <em>and</em> with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.
Prv18:21 Death and life <em>are</em> in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
Prv18:22 <em>Whoso</em> findeth a wife findeth a good <em>thing</em>, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.
Prv18:23 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.
Prv18:24 A man <em>that hath</em> friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend <em>that</em> sticketh closer than a brother.
Prv19:1 Better <em>is</em> the poor that walketh in his integrity, than <em>he that is</em> perverse in his lips, and is a fool.
Prv19:2 Also, <em>that</em> the soul <em>be</em> without knowledge, <em>it is</em> not good; and he that hasteth with <em>his</em> feet sinneth.
Prv19:3 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.
Prv19:4 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.
Prv19:5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and <em>he that</em> speaketh lies shall not escape.
Prv19:6 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man <em>is</em> a friend to him that giveth gifts.
Prv19:7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth <em>them with</em> words, <em>yet</em> they <em>are</em> wanting <em>to him</em>.
Prv19:8 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.
Prv19:9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and <em>he that</em> speaketh lies shall perish.
Prv19:10 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.
Prv19:11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and <em>it is</em> his glory to pass over a transgression.
Prv19:12 The king's wrath <em>is</em> as the roaring of a lion; but his favour <em>is</em> as dew upon the grass.
Prv19:13 A foolish son <em>is</em> the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife <em>are</em> a continual dropping.
Prv19:14 House and riches <em>are</em> the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife <em>is</em> from the LORD.
Prv19:15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.
Prv19:16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; <em>but</em> he that despiseth his ways shall die.
Prv19:17 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.
Prv19:18 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.
Prv19:19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver <em>him</em>, yet thou must do it again.
Prv19:20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.
Prv19:21 <em>There are</em> many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.
Prv19:22 The desire of a man <em>is</em> his kindness: and a poor man <em>is</em> better than a liar.
Prv19:23 The fear of the LORD <em>tendeth</em> to life: and <em>he that hath it</em> shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.
Prv19:24 A slothful <em>man</em> hideth his hand in <em>his</em> bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
Prv19:25 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, <em>and</em> he will understand knowledge.
Prv19:26 He that wasteth <em>his</em> father, <em>and</em> chaseth away <em>his</em> mother, <em>is</em> a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.
Prv19:27 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction <em>that causeth</em> to err from the words of knowledge.
Prv19:28 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.
Prv19:29 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
Prv20:1 Wine <em>is</em> a mocker, strong drink <em>is</em> raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.
Prv20:2 The fear of a king <em>is</em> as the roaring of a lion: <em>whoso</em> provoketh him to anger sinneth <em>against</em> his own soul.
Prv20:3 <em>It is</em> an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.
Prv20:4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; <em>therefore</em> shall he beg in harvest, and <em>have</em> nothing.
Prv20:5 Counsel in the heart of man <em>is like</em> deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.
Prv20:6 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?
Prv20:7 The just <em>man</em> walketh in his integrity: his children <em>are</em> blessed after him.
Prv20:8 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.
Prv20:9 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?
Prv20:10 Divers weights, <em>and</em> divers measures, both of them <em>are</em> alike abomination to the LORD.
Prv20:11 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work <em>be</em> pure, and whether <em>it be</em> right.
Prv20:12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.
Prv20:13 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, <em>and</em> thou shalt be satisfied with bread.
Prv20:14 <em>It is</em> naught, <em>it is</em> naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.
Prv20:15 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge <em>are</em> a precious jewel.
Prv20:16 Take his garment that is surety <em>for</em> a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
Prv20:17 Bread of deceit <em>is</em> sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
Prv20:18 <em>Every</em> purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.
Prv20:19 He that goeth about <em>as</em> a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.
Prv20:20 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.
Prv20:21 An inheritance <em>may be</em> gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.
Prv20:22 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; <em>but</em> wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.
Prv20:23 Divers weights <em>are</em> an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance <em>is</em> not good.
Prv20:24 Man's goings <em>are</em> of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?
Prv20:25 <em>It is</em> a snare to the man <em>who</em> devoureth <em>that which is</em> holy, and after vows to make inquiry.
Prv20:26 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.
Prv20:27 The spirit of man <em>is</em> the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.
Prv20:28 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.
Prv20:29 The glory of young men <em>is</em> their strength: and the beauty of old men <em>is</em> the gray head.
Prv20:30 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so <em>do</em> stripes the inward parts of the belly.
Prv21:1 The king's heart <em>is</em> in the hand of the LORD, <em>as</em> the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.
Prv21:2 Every way of a man <em>is</em> right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.
Prv21:3 To do justice and judgment <em>is</em> more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.
Prv21:4 An high look, and a proud heart, <em>and</em> the plowing of the wicked, <em>is</em> sin.
Prv21:5 The thoughts of the diligent <em>tend</em> only to plenteousness; but of every one <em>that is</em> hasty only to want.
Prv21:6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue <em>is</em> a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.
Prv21:7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.
Prv21:8 The way of man <em>is</em> froward and strange: but <em>as for</em> the pure, his work <em>is</em> right.
Prv21:9 <em>It is</em> better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.
Prv21:10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.
Prv21:11 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.
Prv21:12 The righteous <em>man</em> wisely considereth the house of the wicked: <em>but God</em> overthroweth the wicked for <em>their</em> wickedness.
Prv21:13 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.
Prv21:14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.
Prv21:15 <em>It is</em> joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction <em>shall be</em> to the workers of iniquity.
Prv21:16 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.
Prv21:17 He that loveth pleasure <em>shall be</em> a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.
Prv21:18 The wicked <em>shall be</em> a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.
Prv21:19 <em>It is</em> better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.
Prv21:20 <em>There is</em> treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.
Prv21:21 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.
Prv21:22 A wise <em>man</em> scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.
Prv21:23 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.
Prv21:24 Proud <em>and</em> haughty scorner <em>is</em> his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.
Prv21:25 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.
Prv21:26 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.
Prv21:27 The sacrifice of the wicked <em>is</em> abomination: how much more, <em>when</em> he bringeth it with a wicked mind?
Prv21:28 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.
Prv21:29 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but <em>as for</em> the upright, he directeth his way.
Prv21:30 <em>There is</em> no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.
Prv21:31 The horse <em>is</em> prepared against the day of battle: but safety <em>is</em> of the LORD.
Prv22:1 A <em>good</em> name <em>is</em> rather to be chosen than great riches, <em>and</em> loving favour rather than silver and gold.
Prv22:2 The rich and poor meet together: the LORD <em>is</em> the maker of them all.
Prv22:3 A prudent <em>man</em> foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.
Prv22:4 By humility <em>and</em> the fear of the LORD <em>are</em> riches, and honour, and life.
Prv22:5 Thorns <em>and</em> snares <em>are</em> in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.
Prv22:6 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.
Prv22:7 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower <em>is</em> servant to the lender.
Prv22:8 He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.
Prv22:9 He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor.
Prv22:10 Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.
Prv22:11 He that loveth pureness of heart, <em>for</em> the grace of his lips the king <em>shall be</em> his friend.
Prv22:12 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.
Prv22:13 The slothful <em>man</em> saith, <em>There is</em> a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.
Prv22:14 The mouth of strange women <em>is</em> a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.
Prv22:15 Foolishness <em>is</em> bound in the heart of a child; <em>but</em> the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.
Prv22:16 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his <em>riches, and</em> he that giveth to the rich, <em>shall</em> surely <em>come</em> to want.
Prv22:17 Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.
Prv22:18 For <em>it is</em> a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.
Prv22:19 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.
Prv22:20 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,
Prv22:21 That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?
Prv22:22 Rob not the poor, because he <em>is</em> poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:
Prv22:23 For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.
Prv22:24 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:
Prv22:25 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.
Prv22:26 Be not thou <em>one</em> of them that strike hands, <em>or</em> of them that are sureties for debts.
Prv22:27 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?
Prv22:28 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.
Prv22:29 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean <em>men</em>.
Prv23:1 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what <em>is</em> before thee:
Prv23:2 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou <em>be</em> a man given to appetite.
Prv23:3 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they <em>are</em> deceitful meat.
Prv23:4 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.
Prv23:5 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for <em>riches</em> certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.
Prv23:6 Eat thou not the bread of <em>him that hath</em> an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:
Prv23:7 For as he thinketh in his heart, so <em>is</em> he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart <em>is</em> not with thee.
Prv23:8 The morsel <em>which</em> thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.
Prv23:9 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.
Prv23:10 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:
Prv23:11 For their redeemer <em>is</em> mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.
Prv23:12 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.
Prv23:13 Withhold not correction from the child: for <em>if</em> thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.
Prv23:14 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.
Prv23:15 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.
Prv23:16 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.
Prv23:17 Let not thine heart envy sinners: but <em>be thou</em> in the fear of the LORD all the day long.
Prv23:18 For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.
Prv23:19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.
Prv23:20 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:
Prv23:21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe <em>a man</em> with rags.
Prv23:22 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.
Prv23:23 Buy the truth, and sell <em>it</em> not; <em>also</em> wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.
Prv23:24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise <em>child</em> shall have joy of him.
Prv23:25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.
Prv23:26 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.
Prv23:27 For a whore <em>is</em> a deep ditch; and a strange woman <em>is</em> a narrow pit.
Prv23:28 She also lieth in wait as <em>for</em> a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.
Prv23:29 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?
Prv23:30 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.
Prv23:31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, <em>when</em> it moveth itself aright.
Prv23:32 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.
Prv23:33 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.
Prv23:34 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.
Prv23:35 They have stricken me, <em>shalt thou say, and</em> I was not sick; they have beaten me, <em>and</em> I felt <em>it</em> not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
Prv24:1 Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.
Prv24:2 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.
Prv24:3 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:
Prv24:4 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.
Prv24:5 A wise man <em>is</em> strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.
Prv24:6 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellers <em>there is</em> safety.
Prv24:7 Wisdom <em>is</em> too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.
Prv24:8 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.
Prv24:9 The thought of foolishness <em>is</em> sin: and the scorner <em>is</em> an abomination to men.
Prv24:10 <em>If</em> thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength <em>is</em> small.
Prv24:11 If thou forbear to deliver <em>them that are</em> drawn unto death, and <em>those that are</em> ready to be slain;
Prv24:12 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider <em>it</em>? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth <em>not</em> he know <em>it</em>? and shall <em>not</em> he render to <em>every</em> man according to his works?
Prv24:13 My son, eat thou honey, because <em>it is</em> good; and the honeycomb, <em>which is</em> sweet to thy taste:
Prv24:14 So <em>shall</em> the knowledge of wisdom <em>be</em> unto thy soul: when thou hast found <em>it</em>, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.
Prv24:15 Lay not wait, O wicked <em>man</em>, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:
Prv24:16 For a just <em>man</em> falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.
Prv24:17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:
Prv24:18 Lest the LORD see <em>it</em>, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.
Prv24:19 Fret not thyself because of evil <em>men</em>, neither be thou envious at the wicked;
Prv24:20 For there shall be no reward to the evil <em>man</em>; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.
Prv24:21 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: <em>and</em> meddle not with them that are given to change:
Prv24:22 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?
Prv24:23 These <em>things</em> also <em>belong</em> to the wise. <em>It is</em> not good to have respect of persons in judgment.
Prv24:24 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou <em>art</em> righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:
Prv24:25 But to them that rebuke <em>him</em> shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.
Prv24:26 <em>Every man</em> shall kiss <em>his</em> lips that giveth a right answer.
Prv24:27 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.
Prv24:28 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive <em>not</em> with thy lips.
Prv24:29 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.
Prv24:30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
Prv24:31 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, <em>and</em> nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.
Prv24:32 Then I saw, <em>and</em> considered <em>it</em> well: I looked upon <em>it, and</em> received instruction.
Prv24:33 <em>Yet</em> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
Prv24:34 So shall thy poverty come <em>as</em> one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.
Prv25:1 These <em>are</em> also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
Prv25:2 <em>It is</em> the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings <em>is</em> to search out a matter.
Prv25:3 The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings <em>is</em> unsearchable.
Prv25:4 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
Prv25:5 Take away the wicked <em>from</em> before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
Prv25:6 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great <em>men</em>:
Prv25:7 For better <em>it is</em> that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.
Prv25:8 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest <em>thou know not</em> what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.
Prv25:9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour <em>himself</em>; and discover not a secret to another:
Prv25:10 Lest he that heareth <em>it</em> put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.
Prv25:11 A word fitly spoken <em>is like</em> apples of gold in pictures of silver.
Prv25:12 <em>As</em> an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, <em>so is</em> a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
Prv25:13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, <em>so is</em> a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.
Prv25:14 Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift <em>is like</em> clouds and wind without rain.
Prv25:15 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
Prv25:16 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
Prv25:17 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and <em>so</em> hate thee.
Prv25:18 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour <em>is</em> a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
Prv25:19 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble <em>is like</em> a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
Prv25:20 <em>As</em> he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, <em>and as</em> vinegar upon nitre, so <em>is</em> he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.
Prv25:21 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
Prv25:22 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.
Prv25:23 The north wind driveth away rain: so <em>doth</em> an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
Prv25:24 <em>It is</em> better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
Prv25:25 <em>As</em> cold waters to a thirsty soul, so <em>is</em> good news from a far country.
Prv25:26 A righteous man falling down before the wicked <em>is as</em> a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.
Prv25:27 <em>It is</em> not good to eat much honey: so <em>for men</em> to search their own glory <em>is not</em> glory.
Prv25:28 He that <em>hath</em> no rule over his own spirit <em>is like</em> a city <em>that is</em> broken down, <em>and</em> without walls.
Prv26:1 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.
Prv26:2 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.
Prv26:3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.
Prv26:4 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.
Prv26:5 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.
Prv26:6 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, <em>and</em> drinketh damage.
Prv26:7 The legs of the lame are not equal: so <em>is</em> a parable in the mouth of fools.
Prv26:8 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so <em>is</em> he that giveth honour to a fool.
Prv26:9 <em>As</em> a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so <em>is</em> a parable in the mouth of fools.
Prv26:10 The great <em>God</em> that formed all <em>things</em> both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.
Prv26:11 As a dog returneth to his vomit, <em>so</em> a fool returneth to his folly.
Prv26:12 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? <em>there is</em> more hope of a fool than of him.
Prv26:13 The slothful <em>man</em> saith, <em>There is</em> a lion in the way; a lion <em>is</em> in the streets.
Prv26:14 <em>As</em> the door turneth upon his hinges, so <em>doth</em> the slothful upon his bed.
Prv26:15 The slothful hideth his hand in <em>his</em> bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.
Prv26:16 The sluggard <em>is</em> wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.
Prv26:17 He that passeth by, <em>and</em> meddleth with strife <em>belonging</em> not to him, <em>is like</em> one that taketh a dog by the ears.
Prv26:18 As a mad <em>man</em> who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,
Prv26:19 So <em>is</em> the man <em>that</em> deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?
Prv26:20 Where no wood is, <em>there</em> the fire goeth out: so where <em>there is</em> no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.
Prv26:21 <em>As</em> coals <em>are</em> to burning coals, and wood to fire; so <em>is</em> a contentious man to kindle strife.
Prv26:22 The words of a talebearer <em>are</em> as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
Prv26:23 Burning lips and a wicked heart <em>are like</em> a potsherd covered with silver dross.
Prv26:24 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;
Prv26:25 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for <em>there are</em> seven abominations in his heart.
Prv26:26 <em>Whose</em> hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the <em>whole</em> congregation.
Prv26:27 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.
Prv26:28 A lying tongue hateth <em>those that are</em> afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
Prv27:1 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
Prv27:2 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.
Prv27:3 A stone <em>is</em> heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath <em>is</em> heavier than them both.
Prv27:4 Wrath <em>is</em> cruel, and anger <em>is</em> outrageous; but who <em>is</em> able to stand before envy?
Prv27:5 Open rebuke <em>is</em> better than secret love.
Prv27:6 Faithful <em>are</em> the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy <em>are</em> deceitful.
Prv27:7 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
Prv27:8 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so <em>is</em> a man that wandereth from his place.
Prv27:9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so <em>doth</em> the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.
Prv27:10 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: <em>for</em> better <em>is</em> a neighbour <em>that is</em> near than a brother far off.
Prv27:11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.
Prv27:12 A prudent <em>man</em> foreseeth the evil, <em>and</em> hideth himself; <em>but</em> the simple pass on, <em>and</em> are punished.
Prv27:13 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
Prv27:14 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
Prv27:15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
Prv27:16 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, <em>which</em> bewrayeth <em>itself</em>.
Prv27:17 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
Prv27:18 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.
Prv27:19 As in water face <em>answereth</em> to face, so the heart of man to man.
Prv27:20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.

Prv27:22 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, <em>yet</em> will not his foolishness depart from him.
Prv27:23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, <em>and</em> look well to thy herds.
Prv27:24 For riches <em>are</em> not for ever: and doth the crown <em>endure</em> to every generation?
Prv27:25 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.
Prv27:26 The lambs <em>are</em> for thy clothing, and the goats <em>are</em> the price of the field.
Prv27:27 And <em>thou shalt have</em> goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and <em>for</em> the maintenance for thy maidens.
Prv28:1 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.
Prv28:2 For the transgression of a land many <em>are</em> the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding <em>and</em> knowledge the state <em>thereof</em> shall be prolonged.
Prv28:3 A poor man that oppresseth the poor <em>is like</em> a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.
Prv28:4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.
Prv28:5 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all <em>things</em>.
Prv28:6 Better <em>is</em> the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than <em>he that is</em> perverse <em>in his</em> ways, though he <em>be</em> rich.
Prv28:7 Whoso keepeth the law <em>is</em> a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous <em>men</em> shameth his father.
Prv28:8 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.
Prv28:9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer <em>shall be</em> abomination.
Prv28:10 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good <em>things</em> in possession.
Prv28:11 The rich man <em>is</em> wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.
Prv28:12 When righteous <em>men</em> do rejoice, <em>there is</em> great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.
Prv28:13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh <em>them</em> shall have mercy.
Prv28:14 Happy <em>is</em> the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.
Prv28:15 <em>As</em> a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; <em>so is</em> a wicked ruler over the poor people.
Prv28:16 The prince that wanteth understanding <em>is</em> also a great oppressor: <em>but</em> he that hateth covetousness shall prolong <em>his</em> days.
Prv28:17 A man that doeth violence to the blood of <em>any</em> person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.
Prv28:18 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but <em>he that is</em> perverse <em>in his</em> ways shall fall at once.
Prv28:19 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain <em>persons</em> shall have poverty enough.
Prv28:20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.
Prv28:21 To have respect of persons <em>is</em> not good: for for a piece of bread <em>that</em> man will transgress.
Prv28:22 He that hasteth to be rich <em>hath</em> an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.
Prv28:23 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.
Prv28:24 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, <em>It is</em> no transgression; the same <em>is</em> the companion of a destroyer.
Prv28:25 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.
Prv28:26 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
Prv28:27 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.

Prv29:1 He, that being often reproved hardeneth <em>his</em> neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.
Prv29:2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.
Prv29:3 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth <em>his</em> substance.
Prv29:4 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.
Prv29:5 A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.
Prv29:6 In the transgression of an evil man <em>there is</em> a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.
Prv29:7 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: <em>but</em> the wicked regardeth not to know <em>it</em>.
Prv29:8 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise <em>men</em> turn away wrath.
Prv29:9 <em>If</em> a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, <em>there is</em> no rest.
Prv29:10 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.
Prv29:11 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise <em>man</em> keepeth it in till afterwards.
Prv29:12 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants <em>are</em> wicked.
Prv29:13 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.
Prv29:14 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.
Prv29:15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left <em>to himself</em> bringeth his mother to shame.
Prv29:16 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.
Prv29:17 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.
Prv29:18 Where <em>there is</em> no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy <em>is</em> he.
Prv29:19 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.
Prv29:20 Seest thou a man <em>that is</em> hasty in his words? <em>there is</em> more hope of a fool than of him.
Prv29:21 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become <em>his</em> son at the length.
Prv29:22 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.
Prv29:23 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.
Prv29:24 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth <em>it</em> not.
Prv29:25 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.
Prv29:26 Many seek the ruler's favour; but <em>every</em> man's judgment <em>cometh</em> from the LORD.
Prv29:27 An unjust man <em>is</em> an abomination to the just: and <em>he that is</em> upright in the way <em>is</em> abomination to the wicked.
Prv30:1 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, <em>even</em> the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,
Prv30:2 Surely I <em>am</em> more brutish than <em>any</em> man, and have not the understanding of a man.
Prv30:3 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.
Prv30:4 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what <em>is</em> his name, and what <em>is</em> his son's name, if thou canst tell?
Prv30:5 Every word of God <em>is</em> pure: he <em>is</em> a shield unto them that put their trust in him.
Prv30:6 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
Prv30:7 Two <em>things</em> have I required of thee; deny me <em>them</em> not before I die:
Prv30:8 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:
Prv30:9 Lest I be full, and deny <em>thee</em>, and say, Who <em>is</em> the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God <em>in vain</em>.
Prv30:10 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.
Prv30:11 <em>There is</em> a generation <em>that</em> curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.
Prv30:12 <em>There is</em> a generation <em>that are</em> pure in their own eyes, and <em>yet</em> is not washed from their filthiness.
Prv30:13 <em>There is</em> a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.
Prv30:14 <em>There is</em> a generation, whose teeth <em>are as</em> swords, and their jaw teeth <em>as</em> knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from <em>among</em> men.
Prv30:15 The horseleach hath two daughters, <em>crying</em>, Give, give. There are three <em>things that</em> are never satisfied, <em>yea</em>, four <em>things</em> say not, <em>It is</em> enough:
Prv30:16 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth <em>that</em> is not filled with water; and the fire <em>that</em> saith not, <em>It is</em> enough.
Prv30:17 The eye <em>that</em> mocketh at <em>his</em> father, and despiseth to obey <em>his</em> mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.
Prv30:18 There be three <em>things which</em> are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:
Prv30:19 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
Prv30:20 Such <em>is</em> the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.
Prv30:21 For three <em>things</em> the earth is disquieted, and for four <em>which</em> it cannot bear:
Prv30:22 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;
Prv30:23 For an odious <em>woman</em> when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
Prv30:24 There be four <em>things which are</em> little upon the earth, but they <em>are</em> exceeding wise:
Prv30:25 The ants <em>are</em> a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;
Prv30:26 The conies <em>are but</em> a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;
Prv30:27 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;
Prv30:28 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.
Prv30:29 There be three <em>things</em> which go well, yea, four are comely in going:
Prv30:30 A lion <em>which is</em> strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;
Prv30:31 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom <em>there is</em> no rising up.
Prv30:32 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, <em>lay</em> thine hand upon thy mouth.
Prv30:33 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
Prv31:1 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.
Prv31:2 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?
Prv31:3 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.
Prv31:4 <em>It is</em> not for kings, O Lemuel, <em>it is</em> not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:
Prv31:5 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
Prv31:6 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
Prv31:7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
Prv31:8 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.
Prv31:9 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
Prv31:10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price <em>is</em> far above rubies.
Prv31:11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.
Prv31:12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
Prv31:13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.
Prv31:14 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.
Prv31:15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
Prv31:16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
Prv31:17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.
Prv31:18 She perceiveth that her merchandise <em>is</em> good: her candle goeth not out by night.
Prv31:19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.
Prv31:20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
Prv31:21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household <em>are</em> clothed with scarlet.
Prv31:22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing <em>is</em> silk and purple.
Prv31:23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.
Prv31:24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth <em>it</em>; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.
Prv31:25 Strength and honour <em>are</em> her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.
Prv31:26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue <em>is</em> the law of kindness.
Prv31:27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
Prv31:28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband <em>also</em>, and he praiseth her.
Prv31:29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.
Prv31:30 Favour <em>is</em> deceitful, and beauty <em>is</em> vain: <em>but</em> a woman <em>that</em> feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.
Prv31:31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
