Psa1:1 Blessed <em>is</em> the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
Psa1:2 But his delight <em>is</em> in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
Psa1:3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
Psa1:4 The ungodly <em>are</em> not so: but <em>are</em> like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
Psa1:5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
Psa1:6 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
Psa2:1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
Psa2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, <em>saying</em>,
Psa2:3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
Psa2:4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.
Psa2:5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.
Psa2:6 [[Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.]]
Psa2:7 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, [[Thou <em>art</em> my Son; this day have I begotten thee.]]
Psa2:8 [[Ask of me, and I shall give <em>thee</em> the heathen <em>for</em> thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth <em>for</em> thy possession.]]
Psa2:9 [[Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.]]
Psa2:10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
Psa2:11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
Psa2:12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish <em>from</em> the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed <em>are</em> all they that put their trust in him.
Psa3:1 <<A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.>> LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many <em>are</em> they that rise up against me.
Psa3:2 Many <em>there be</em> which say of my soul, <em>There is</em> no help for him in God. Selah.
Psa3:3 But thou, O LORD, <em>art</em> a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
Psa3:4 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.
Psa3:5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
Psa3:6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set <em>themselves</em> against me round about.
Psa3:7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies <em>upon</em> the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Psa3:8 Salvation <em>belongeth</em> unto the LORD: thy blessing <em>is</em> upon thy people. Selah.
Psa4:1 <<To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David.>> Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me <em>when I was</em> in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
Psa4:2 O ye sons of men, how long <em>will ye turn</em> my glory into shame? <em>how long</em> will ye love vanity, <em>and</em> seek after leasing? Selah.
Psa4:3 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.
Psa4:4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
Psa4:5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.
Psa4:6 <em>There be</em> many that say, Who will shew us <em>any</em> good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
Psa4:7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time <em>that</em> their corn and their wine increased.
Psa4:8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.
Psa5:1 <<To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David.>> Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
Psa5:2 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.
Psa5:3 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct <em>my prayer</em> unto thee, and will look up.
Psa5:4 For thou <em>art</em> not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.
Psa5:5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
Psa5:6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
Psa5:7 But as for me, I will come <em>into</em> thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: <em>and</em> in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Psa5:8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
Psa5:9 For <em>there is</em> no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part <em>is</em> very wickedness; their throat <em>is</em> an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
Psa5:10 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
Psa5:11 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
Psa5:12 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as <em>with</em> a shield.
Psa6:1 <<To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.>> O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
Psa6:2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I <em>am</em> weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.
Psa6:3 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?
Psa6:4 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.
Psa6:5 For in death <em>there is</em> no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
Psa6:6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
Psa6:7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
Psa6:8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.
Psa6:9 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.
Psa6:10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return <em>and</em> be ashamed suddenly.
Psa7:1 <<Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.>> O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:
Psa7:2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending <em>it</em> in pieces, while <em>there is</em> none to deliver.
Psa7:3 O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;
Psa7:4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
Psa7:5 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take <em>it</em>; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.
Psa7:6 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me <em>to</em> the judgment <em>that</em> thou hast commanded.
Psa7:7 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
Psa7:8 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity <em>that is</em> in me.
Psa7:9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
Psa7:10 My defence <em>is</em> of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
Psa7:11 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry <em>with the wicked</em> every day.
Psa7:12 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
Psa7:13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
Psa7:14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
Psa7:15 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch <em>which</em> he made.
Psa7:16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
Psa7:17 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
Psa8:1 <<To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David.>> O LORD our Lord, how excellent <em>is</em> thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
Psa8:2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
Psa8:3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
Psa8:4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
Psa8:5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
Psa8:6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all <em>things</em> under his feet:
Psa8:7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
Psa8:8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, <em>and whatsoever</em> passeth through the paths of the seas.
Psa8:9 O LORD our Lord, how excellent <em>is</em> thy name in all the earth!
Psa9:1 <<To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David.>> I will praise <em>thee</em>, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.
Psa9:2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.
Psa9:3 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
Psa9:4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
Psa9:5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
Psa9:6 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
Psa9:7 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.
Psa9:8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
Psa9:9 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
Psa9:10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
Psa9:11 Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.
Psa9:12 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
Psa9:13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble <em>which I suffer</em> of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
Psa9:14 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
Psa9:15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit <em>that</em> they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
Psa9:16 The LORD is known <em>by</em> the judgment <em>which</em> he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
Psa9:17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, <em>and</em> all the nations that forget God.
Psa9:18 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall <em>not</em> perish for ever.
Psa9:19 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.
Psa9:20 Put them in fear, O LORD: <em>that</em> the nations may know themselves <em>to be but</em> men. Selah.
Psa10:1 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? <em>why</em> hidest thou <em>thyself</em> in times of trouble?
Psa10:2 The wicked in <em>his</em> pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
Psa10:3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, <em>whom</em> the LORD abhorreth.
Psa10:4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek <em>after God</em>: God <em>is</em> not in all his thoughts.
Psa10:5 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments <em>are</em> far above out of his sight: <em>as for</em> all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
Psa10:6 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for <em>I shall</em> never <em>be</em> in adversity.
Psa10:7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue <em>is</em> mischief and vanity.
Psa10:8 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.
Psa10:9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.
Psa10:10 He croucheth, <em>and</em> humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.
Psa10:11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see <em>it</em>.
Psa10:12 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.
Psa10:13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require <em>it</em>.
Psa10:14 Thou hast seen <em>it</em>; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite <em>it</em> with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.
Psa10:15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil <em>man</em>: seek out his wickedness <em>till</em> thou find none.
Psa10:16 The LORD <em>is</em> King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.
Psa10:17 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
Psa10:18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
Psa11:1 <<To the chief Musician, (A Psalm) of David.>> In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee <em>as</em> a bird to your mountain?
Psa11:2 For, lo, the wicked bend <em>their</em> bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
Psa11:3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
Psa11:4 The LORD <em>is</em> in his holy temple, the LORD's throne <em>is</em> in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
Psa11:5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
Psa11:6 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: <em>this shall be</em> the portion of their cup.
Psa11:7 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
Psa12:1 <<To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.>> Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.
Psa12:2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: <em>with</em> flattering lips <em>and</em> with a double heart do they speak.
Psa12:3 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, <em>and</em> the tongue that speaketh proud things:
Psa12:4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips <em>are</em> our own: who <em>is</em> lord over us?
Psa12:5 [[For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise,]] saith the LORD; [[I will set <em>him</em> in safety <em>from him that</em> puffeth at him.]]
Psa12:6 The words of the LORD <em>are</em> pure words: <em>as</em> silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
Psa12:7 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
Psa12:8 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
Psa13:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.>> How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
Psa13:2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, <em>having</em> sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
Psa13:3 Consider <em>and</em> hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the <em>sleep of</em> death;
Psa13:4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; <em>and</em> those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
Psa13:5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
Psa13:6 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
Psa14:1 <<To the chief Musician, (A Psalm) of David.>> The fool hath said in his heart, <em>There is</em> no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, <em>there is</em> none that doeth good.
Psa14:2 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, <em>and</em> seek God.
Psa14:3 They are all gone aside, they are <em>all</em> together become filthy: <em>there is</em> none that doeth good, no, not one.
Psa14:4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people <em>as</em> they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.
Psa14:5 There were they in great fear: for God <em>is</em> in the generation of the righteous.
Psa14:6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD <em>is</em> his refuge.
Psa14:7 Oh that the salvation of Israel <em>were come</em> out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, <em>and</em> Israel shall be glad.
Psa15:1 <<A Psalm of David.>> LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
Psa15:2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.
Psa15:3 <em>He that</em> backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.
Psa15:4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. <em>He that</em> sweareth to <em>his own</em> hurt, and changeth not.
Psa15:5 <em>He that</em> putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these <em>things</em> shall never be moved.
Psa16:1 <<Michtam of David.>> Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
Psa16:2 <em>O my soul</em>, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou <em>art</em> my Lord: my goodness <em>extendeth</em> not to thee;
Psa16:3 <em>But</em> to the saints that <em>are</em> in the earth, and <em>to</em> the excellent, in whom <em>is</em> all my delight.
Psa16:4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied <em>that</em> hasten <em>after</em> another <em>god</em>: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.
Psa16:5 The LORD <em>is</em> the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.
Psa16:6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant <em>places</em>; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
Psa16:7 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.
Psa16:8 I have set the LORD always before me: because <em>he is</em> at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
Psa16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
Psa16:10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
Psa16:11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence <em>is</em> fulness of joy; at thy right hand <em>there are</em> pleasures for evermore.
Psa17:1 <<A Prayer of David.>> Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, <em>that goeth</em> not out of feigned lips.
Psa17:2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.
Psa17:3 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited <em>me</em> in the night; thou hast tried me, <em>and</em> shalt find nothing; I am purposed <em>that</em> my mouth shall not transgress.
Psa17:4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept <em>me from</em> the paths of the destroyer.
Psa17:5 Hold up my goings in thy paths, <em>that</em> my footsteps slip not.
Psa17:6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, <em>and hear</em> my speech.
Psa17:7 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust <em>in thee</em> from those that rise up <em>against them</em>.
Psa17:8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
Psa17:9 From the wicked that oppress me, <em>from</em> my deadly enemies, <em>who</em> compass me about.
Psa17:10 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.
Psa17:11 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;
Psa17:12 Like as a lion <em>that</em> is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
Psa17:13 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, <em>which is</em> thy sword:
Psa17:14 From men <em>which are</em> thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, <em>which have</em> their portion in <em>this</em> life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid <em>treasure</em>: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their <em>substance</em> to their babes.
Psa17:15 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
Psa18:1 <<To the chief Musician, (A Psalm) of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day <em>that</em> the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,>> I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
Psa18:2 The LORD <em>is</em> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, <em>and</em> my high tower.
Psa18:3 I will call upon the LORD, <em>who is worthy</em> to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
Psa18:4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
Psa18:5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.
Psa18:6 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, <em>even</em> into his ears.
Psa18:7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
Psa18:8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
Psa18:9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness <em>was</em> under his feet.
Psa18:10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
Psa18:11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him <em>were</em> dark waters <em>and</em> thick clouds of the skies.
Psa18:12 At the brightness <em>that was</em> before him his thick clouds passed, hail <em>stones</em> and coals of fire.
Psa18:13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail <em>stones</em> and coals of fire.
Psa18:14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
Psa18:15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
Psa18:16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
Psa18:17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.
Psa18:18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
Psa18:19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
Psa18:20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
Psa18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
Psa18:22 For all his judgments <em>were</em> before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
Psa18:23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
Psa18:24 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
Psa18:25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
Psa18:26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.
Psa18:27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.
Psa18:28 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.
Psa18:29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
Psa18:30 <em>As for</em> God, his way <em>is</em> perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he <em>is</em> a buckler to all those that trust in him.
Psa18:31 For who <em>is</em> God save the LORD? or who <em>is</em> a rock save our God?
Psa18:32 <em>It is</em> God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.
Psa18:33 He maketh my feet like hinds' <em>feet</em>, and setteth me upon my high places.
Psa18:34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
Psa18:35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
Psa18:36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
Psa18:37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
Psa18:38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.
Psa18:39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
Psa18:40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.
Psa18:41 They cried, but <em>there was</em> none to save <em>them: even</em> unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
Psa18:42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
Psa18:43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; <em>and</em> thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people <em>whom</em> I have not known shall serve me.
Psa18:44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
Psa18:45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.
Psa18:46 The LORD liveth; and blessed <em>be</em> my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
Psa18:47 <em>It is</em> God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
Psa18:48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
Psa18:49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.
Psa18:50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
Psa19:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.>> The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.
Psa19:2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
Psa19:3 <em>There is</em> no speech nor language, <em>where</em> their voice is not heard.
Psa19:4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
Psa19:5 Which <em>is</em> as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, <em>and</em> rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.
Psa19:6 His going forth <em>is</em> from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
Psa19:7 The law of the LORD <em>is</em> perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD <em>is</em> sure, making wise the simple.
Psa19:8 The statutes of the LORD <em>are</em> right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD <em>is</em> pure, enlightening the eyes.
Psa19:9 The fear of the LORD <em>is</em> clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD <em>are</em> true <em>and</em> righteous altogether.
Psa19:10 More to be desired <em>are they</em> than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
Psa19:11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: <em>and</em> in keeping of them <em>there is</em> great reward.
Psa19:12 Who can understand <em>his</em> errors? cleanse thou me from secret <em>faults</em>.
Psa19:13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous <em>sins</em>; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
Psa19:14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.
Psa20:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.>> The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;
Psa20:2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;
Psa20:3 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.
Psa20:4 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.
Psa20:5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up <em>our</em> banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.
Psa20:6 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.
Psa20:7 Some <em>trust</em> in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.
Psa20:8 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Psa20:9 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
Psa21:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.>> The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
Psa21:2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.
Psa21:3 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.
Psa21:4 He asked life of thee, <em>and</em> thou gavest <em>it</em> him, <em>even</em> length of days for ever and ever.
Psa21:5 His glory <em>is</em> great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.
Psa21:6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
Psa21:7 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.
Psa21:8 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
Psa21:9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
Psa21:10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
Psa21:11 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, <em>which</em> they are not able <em>to perform</em>.
Psa21:12 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, <em>when</em> thou shalt make ready <em>thine arrows</em> upon thy strings against the face of them.
Psa21:13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: <em>so</em> will we sing and praise thy power.
Psa22:1 <<To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David.>> My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? <em>why art thou so</em> far from helping me, <em>and from</em> the words of my roaring?
Psa22:2 O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.
Psa22:3 But thou <em>art</em> holy, <em>O thou</em> that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
Psa22:4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
Psa22:5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
Psa22:6 But I <em>am</em> a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.
Psa22:7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, <em>saying</em>,
Psa22:8 He trusted on the LORD <em>that</em> he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.
Psa22:9 But thou <em>art</em> he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope <em>when I was</em> upon my mother's breasts.
Psa22:10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou <em>art</em> my God from my mother's belly.
Psa22:11 Be not far from me; for trouble <em>is</em> near; for <em>there is</em> none to help.
Psa22:12 Many bulls have compassed me: strong <em>bulls</em> of Bashan have beset me round.
Psa22:13 They gaped upon me <em>with</em> their mouths, <em>as</em> a ravening and a roaring lion.
Psa22:14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
Psa22:15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
Psa22:16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
Psa22:17 I may tell all my bones: they look <em>and</em> stare upon me.
Psa22:18 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
Psa22:19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.
Psa22:20 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.
Psa22:21 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.
Psa22:22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
Psa22:23 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.
Psa22:24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.
Psa22:25 My praise <em>shall be</em> of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
Psa22:26 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.
Psa22:27 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
Psa22:28 For the kingdom <em>is</em> the LORD's: and he <em>is</em> the governor among the nations.
Psa22:29 All <em>they that be</em> fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.
Psa22:30 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.
Psa22:31 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done <em>this</em>.
Psa23:1 <<A Psalm of David.>> The LORD <em>is</em> my shepherd; I shall not want.
Psa23:2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
Psa23:3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Psa23:4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou <em>art</em> with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
Psa23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Psa23:6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
Psa24:1 <<A Psalm of David.>> The earth <em>is</em> the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
Psa24:2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.
Psa24:3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?
Psa24:4 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
Psa24:5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
Psa24:6 This <em>is</em> the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.
Psa24:7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
Psa24:8 Who <em>is</em> this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.
Psa24:9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift <em>them</em> up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
Psa24:10 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he <em>is</em> the King of glory. Selah.
Psa25:1 <<(A Psalm) of David.>> Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.
Psa25:2 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.
Psa25:3 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.
Psa25:4 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.
Psa25:5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou <em>art</em> the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.
Psa25:6 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they <em>have been</em> ever of old.
Psa25:7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.
Psa25:8 Good and upright <em>is</em> the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
Psa25:9 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.
Psa25:10 All the paths of the LORD <em>are</em> mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
Psa25:11 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it <em>is</em> great.
Psa25:12 What man <em>is</em> he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way <em>that</em> he shall choose.
Psa25:13 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.
Psa25:14 The secret of the LORD <em>is</em> with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.
Psa25:15 Mine eyes <em>are</em> ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.
Psa25:16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I <em>am</em> desolate and afflicted.
Psa25:17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: <em>O</em> bring thou me out of my distresses.
Psa25:18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.
Psa25:19 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.
Psa25:20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.
Psa25:21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
Psa25:22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
Psa26:1 <<(A Psalm) of David.>> Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; <em>therefore</em> I shall not slide.
Psa26:2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
Psa26:3 For thy lovingkindness <em>is</em> before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.
Psa26:4 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.
Psa26:5 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.
Psa26:6 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:
Psa26:7 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.
Psa26:8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.
Psa26:9 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:
Psa26:10 In whose hands <em>is</em> mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.
Psa26:11 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.
Psa26:12 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
Psa27:1 <<(A Psalm) of David.>> The LORD <em>is</em> my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD <em>is</em> the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
Psa27:2 When the wicked, <em>even</em> mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
Psa27:3 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this <em>will</em> I <em>be</em> confident.
Psa27:4 One <em>thing</em> have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple.
Psa27:5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.
Psa27:6 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.
Psa27:7 Hear, O LORD, <em>when</em> I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
Psa27:8 <em>When thou saidst</em>, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.
Psa27:9 Hide not thy face <em>far</em> from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
Psa27:10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.
Psa27:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.
Psa27:12 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.
Psa27:13 <em>I had fainted</em>, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.
Psa27:14 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.
Psa28:1 <<(A Psalm) of David.>> Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, <em>if</em> thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
Psa28:2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
Psa28:3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief <em>is</em> in their hearts.
Psa28:4 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.
Psa28:5 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.
Psa28:6 Blessed <em>be</em> the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
Psa28:7 The LORD <em>is</em> my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.
Psa28:8 The LORD <em>is</em> their strength, and he <em>is</em> the saving strength of his anointed.
Psa28:9 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.
Psa29:1 <<A Psalm of David.>> Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength.
Psa29:2 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
Psa29:3 The voice of the LORD <em>is</em> upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD <em>is</em> upon many waters.
Psa29:4 The voice of the LORD <em>is</em> powerful; the voice of the LORD <em>is</em> full of majesty.
Psa29:5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.
Psa29:6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.
Psa29:7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.
Psa29:8 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
Psa29:9 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of <em>his</em> glory.
Psa29:10 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever.
Psa29:11 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.
Psa30:1 <<A Psalm <em>and</em> Song <em>at</em> the dedication of the house of David.>> I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
Psa30:2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
Psa30:3 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
Psa30:4 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
Psa30:5 For his anger <em>endureth but</em> a moment; in his favour <em>is</em> life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy <em>cometh</em> in the morning.
Psa30:6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
Psa30:7 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, <em>and</em> I was troubled.
Psa30:8 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.
Psa30:9 What profit <em>is there</em> in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
Psa30:10 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.
Psa30:11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
Psa30:12 To the end that <em>my</em> glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
Psa31:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.>> In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.
Psa31:2 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.
Psa31:3 For thou <em>art</em> my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.
Psa31:4 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou <em>art</em> my strength.
Psa31:5 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.
Psa31:6 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.
Psa31:7 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;
Psa31:8 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.
Psa31:9 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, <em>yea</em>, my soul and my belly.
Psa31:10 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.
Psa31:11 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.
Psa31:12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.
Psa31:13 For I have heard the slander of many: fear <em>was</em> on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.
Psa31:14 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou <em>art</em> my God.
Psa31:15 My times <em>are</em> in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
Psa31:16 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.
Psa31:17 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, <em>and</em> let them be silent in the grave.
Psa31:18 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
Psa31:19 <em>Oh</em> how great <em>is</em> thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; <em>which</em> thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!
Psa31:20 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
Psa31:21 Blessed <em>be</em> the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.
Psa31:22 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.
Psa31:23 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: <em>for</em> the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.
Psa31:24 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.
Psa32:1 <<(A Psalm) of David, Maschil.>> Blessed <em>is he whose</em> transgression <em>is</em> forgiven, <em>whose</em> sin <em>is</em> covered.
Psa32:2 Blessed <em>is</em> the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit <em>there is</em> no guile.
Psa32:3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.
Psa32:4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
Psa32:5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
Psa32:6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
Psa32:7 Thou <em>art</em> my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.
Psa32:8 [[I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.]]
Psa32:9 [[Be ye not as the horse, <em>or</em> as the mule, <em>which</em> have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.]]
Psa32:10 Many sorrows <em>shall be</em> to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.
Psa32:11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all <em>ye that are</em> upright in heart.
Psa33:1 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: <em>for</em> praise is comely for the upright.
Psa33:2 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery <em>and</em> an instrument of ten strings.
Psa33:3 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
Psa33:4 For the word of the LORD <em>is</em> right; and all his works <em>are done</em> in truth.
Psa33:5 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.
Psa33:6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
Psa33:7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.
Psa33:8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
Psa33:9 For he spake, and it was <em>done</em>; he commanded, and it stood fast.
Psa33:10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.
Psa33:11 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
Psa33:12 Blessed <em>is</em> the nation whose God <em>is</em> the LORD; <em>and</em> the people <em>whom</em> he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
Psa33:13 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.
Psa33:14 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
Psa33:15 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.
Psa33:16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
Psa33:17 An horse <em>is</em> a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver <em>any</em> by his great strength.
Psa33:18 Behold, the eye of the LORD <em>is</em> upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;
Psa33:19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
Psa33:20 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he <em>is</em> our help and our shield.
Psa33:21 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.
Psa33:22 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
Psa34:1 <<(A Psalm) of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed.>> I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise <em>shall</em> continually <em>be</em> in my mouth.
Psa34:2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear <em>thereof</em>, and be glad.
Psa34:3 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.
Psa34:4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
Psa34:5 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.
Psa34:6 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard <em>him</em>, and saved him out of all his troubles.
Psa34:7 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.
Psa34:8 O taste and see that the LORD <em>is</em> good: blessed <em>is</em> the man <em>that</em> trusteth in him.
Psa34:9 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for <em>there is</em> no want to them that fear him.
Psa34:10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good <em>thing</em>.
Psa34:11 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
Psa34:12 What man <em>is he that</em> desireth life, <em>and</em> loveth <em>many</em> days, that he may see good?
Psa34:13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
Psa34:14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
Psa34:15 The eyes of the LORD <em>are</em> upon the righteous, and his ears <em>are open</em> unto their cry.
Psa34:16 The face of the LORD <em>is</em> against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
Psa34:17 <em>The righteous</em> cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.
Psa34:18 The LORD <em>is</em> nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.
Psa34:19 Many <em>are</em> the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.
Psa34:20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.
Psa34:21 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.
Psa34:22 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.
Psa35:1 <<(A Psalm) of David.>> Plead <em>my cause</em>, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.
Psa35:2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.
Psa35:3 Draw out also the spear, and stop <em>the way</em> against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I <em>am</em> thy salvation.
Psa35:4 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.
Psa35:5 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase <em>them</em>.
Psa35:6 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.
Psa35:7 For without cause have they hid for me their net <em>in</em> a pit, <em>which</em> without cause they have digged for my soul.
Psa35:8 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.
Psa35:9 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.
Psa35:10 All my bones shall say, LORD, who <em>is</em> like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?
Psa35:11 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge <em>things</em> that I knew not.
Psa35:12 They rewarded me evil for good <em>to</em> the spoiling of my soul.
Psa35:13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing <em>was</em> sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.
Psa35:14 I behaved myself as though <em>he had been</em> my friend <em>or</em> brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth <em>for his</em> mother.
Psa35:15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: <em>yea</em>, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew <em>it</em> not; they did tear <em>me</em>, and ceased not:
Psa35:16 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Psa35:17 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.
Psa35:18 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.
Psa35:19 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: <em>neither</em> let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
Psa35:20 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against <em>them that are</em> quiet in the land.
Psa35:21 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, <em>and</em> said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen <em>it</em>.
Psa35:22 <em>This</em> thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.
Psa35:23 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, <em>even</em> unto my cause, my God and my Lord.
Psa35:24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.
Psa35:25 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
Psa35:26 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify <em>themselves</em> against me.
Psa35:27 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
Psa35:28 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness <em>and</em> of thy praise all the day long.
Psa36:1 <<To the chief Musician, (A Psalm) of David the servant of the LORD.>> The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, <em>that there is</em> no fear of God before his eyes.
Psa36:2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.
Psa36:3 The words of his mouth <em>are</em> iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, <em>and</em> to do good.
Psa36:4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way <em>that is</em> not good; he abhorreth not evil.
Psa36:5 Thy mercy, O LORD, <em>is</em> in the heavens; <em>and</em> thy faithfulness <em>reacheth</em> unto the clouds.
Psa36:6 Thy righteousness <em>is</em> like the great mountains; thy judgments <em>are</em> a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.
Psa36:7 How excellent <em>is</em> thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
Psa36:8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
Psa36:9 For with thee <em>is</em> the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.
Psa36:10 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
Psa36:11 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.
Psa36:12 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.
Psa37:1 <<(A Psalm) of David.>> Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.
Psa37:2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.
Psa37:3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; <em>so</em> shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.
Psa37:4 Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.
Psa37:5 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring <em>it</em> to pass.
Psa37:6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.
Psa37:7 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
Psa37:8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.
Psa37:9 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.
Psa37:10 For yet a little while, and the wicked <em>shall</em> not <em>be</em>: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it <em>shall</em> not <em>be</em>.
Psa37:11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
Psa37:12 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
Psa37:13 The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.
Psa37:14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, <em>and</em> to slay such as be of upright conversation.
Psa37:15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
Psa37:16 A little that a righteous man hath <em>is</em> better than the riches of many wicked.
Psa37:17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.
Psa37:18 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.
Psa37:19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
Psa37:20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD <em>shall be</em> as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.
Psa37:21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.
Psa37:22 For <em>such as be</em> blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and <em>they that be</em> cursed of him shall be cut off.
Psa37:23 The steps of a <em>good</em> man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.
Psa37:24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth <em>him with</em> his hand.
Psa37:25 I have been young, and <em>now</em> am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
Psa37:26 <em>He is</em> ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed <em>is</em> blessed.
Psa37:27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.
Psa37:28 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
Psa37:29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.
Psa37:30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.
Psa37:31 The law of his God <em>is</em> in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.
Psa37:32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
Psa37:33 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.
Psa37:34 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see <em>it</em>.
Psa37:35 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.
Psa37:36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he <em>was</em> not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
Psa37:37 Mark the perfect <em>man</em>, and behold the upright: for the end of <em>that</em> man <em>is</em> peace.
Psa37:38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.
Psa37:39 But the salvation of the righteous <em>is</em> of the LORD: <em>he is</em> their strength in the time of trouble.
Psa37:40 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.
Psa38:1 <<A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.>> O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
Psa38:2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
Psa38:3 <em>There is</em> no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither <em>is there any</em> rest in my bones because of my sin.
Psa38:4 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
Psa38:5 My wounds stink <em>and</em> are corrupt because of my foolishness.
Psa38:6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
Psa38:7 For my loins are filled with a loathsome <em>disease</em>: and <em>there is</em> no soundness in my flesh.
Psa38:8 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
Psa38:9 Lord, all my desire <em>is</em> before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.
Psa38:10 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
Psa38:11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.
Psa38:12 They also that seek after my life lay snares <em>for me</em>: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.
Psa38:13 But I, as a deaf <em>man</em>, heard not; and <em>I was</em> as a dumb man <em>that</em> openeth not his mouth.
Psa38:14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth <em>are</em> no reproofs.
Psa38:15 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
Psa38:16 For I said, <em>Hear me</em>, lest <em>otherwise</em> they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify <em>themselves</em> against me.
Psa38:17 For I <em>am</em> ready to halt, and my sorrow <em>is</em> continually before me.
Psa38:18 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
Psa38:19 But mine enemies <em>are</em> lively, <em>and</em> they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
Psa38:20 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow <em>the thing that</em> good <em>is</em>.
Psa38:21 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.
Psa38:22 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
Psa39:1 <<To the chief Musician, <em>even</em> to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.>> I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.
Psa39:2 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, <em>even</em> from good; and my sorrow was stirred.
Psa39:3 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: <em>then</em> spake I with my tongue,
Psa39:4 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it <em>is; that</em> I may know how frail I <em>am</em>.
Psa39:5 Behold, thou hast made my days <em>as</em> an handbreadth; and mine age <em>is</em> as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state <em>is</em> altogether vanity. Selah.
Psa39:6 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up <em>riches</em>, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
Psa39:7 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope <em>is</em> in thee.
Psa39:8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.
Psa39:9 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst <em>it</em>.
Psa39:10 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.
Psa39:11 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man <em>is</em> vanity. Selah.
Psa39:12 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I <em>am</em> a stranger with thee, <em>and</em> a sojourner, as all my fathers <em>were</em>.
Psa39:13 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
Psa40:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.>> I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
Psa40:2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, <em>and</em> established my goings.
Psa40:3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, <em>even</em> praise unto our God: many shall see <em>it</em>, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.
Psa40:4 Blessed <em>is</em> that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
Psa40:5 Many, O LORD my God, <em>are</em> thy wonderful works <em>which</em> thou hast done, and thy thoughts <em>which are</em> to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: <em>if</em> I would declare and speak <em>of them</em>, they are more than can be numbered.
Psa40:6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
Psa40:7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book <em>it is</em> written of me,
Psa40:8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law <em>is</em> within my heart.
Psa40:9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.
Psa40:10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.
Psa40:11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
Psa40:12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.
Psa40:13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.
Psa40:14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
Psa40:15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.
Psa40:16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.
Psa40:17 But I <em>am</em> poor and needy; <em>yet</em> the Lord thinketh upon me: thou <em>art</em> my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
Psa41:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.>> Blessed <em>is</em> he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.
Psa41:2 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; <em>and</em> he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.
Psa41:3 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.
Psa41:4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
Psa41:5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?
Psa41:6 And if he come to see <em>me</em>, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; <em>when</em> he goeth abroad, he telleth <em>it</em>.
Psa41:7 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.
Psa41:8 An evil disease, <em>say they</em>, cleaveth fast unto him: and <em>now</em> that he lieth he shall rise up no more.
Psa41:9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up <em>his</em> heel against me.
Psa41:10 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.
Psa41:11 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
Psa41:12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.
Psa41:13 Blessed <em>be</em> the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
Psa42:1 <<To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah.>> As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.
Psa42:2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?
Psa42:3 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where <em>is</em> thy God?
Psa42:4 When I remember these <em>things</em>, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.
Psa42:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and <em>why</em> art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him <em>for</em> the help of his countenance.
Psa42:6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.
Psa42:7 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
Psa42:8 <em>Yet</em> the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song <em>shall be</em> with me, <em>and</em> my prayer unto the God of my life.
Psa42:9 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
Psa42:10 <em>As</em> with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where <em>is</em> thy God?
Psa42:11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, <em>who is</em> the health of my countenance, and my God.
Psa43:1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
Psa43:2 For thou <em>art</em> the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
Psa43:3 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.
Psa43:4 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.
Psa43:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, <em>who is</em> the health of my countenance, and my God.
Psa44:1 <<To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil.>> We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, <em>what</em> work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.
Psa44:2 <em>How</em> thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; <em>how</em> thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
Psa44:3 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.
Psa44:4 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.
Psa44:5 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
Psa44:6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
Psa44:7 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.
Psa44:8 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.
Psa44:9 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.
Psa44:10 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.
Psa44:11 Thou hast given us like sheep <em>appointed</em> for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Psa44:12 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase <em>thy wealth</em> by their price.
Psa44:13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
Psa44:14 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.
Psa44:15 My confusion <em>is</em> continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,
Psa44:16 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.
Psa44:17 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
Psa44:18 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;
Psa44:19 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.
Psa44:20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;
Psa44:21 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
Psa44:22 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
Psa44:23 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast <em>us</em> not off for ever.
Psa44:24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, <em>and</em> forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
Psa44:25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.
Psa44:26 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.
Psa45:1 <<To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah, Maschil, A Song of loves.>> My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue <em>is</em> the pen of a ready writer.
Psa45:2 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
Psa45:3 Gird thy sword upon <em>thy</em> thigh, O <em>most</em> mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.
Psa45:4 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness <em>and</em> righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
Psa45:5 Thine arrows <em>are</em> sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; <em>whereby</em> the people fall under thee.
Psa45:6 Thy throne, O God, <em>is</em> for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom <em>is</em> a right sceptre.
Psa45:7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
Psa45:8 All thy garments <em>smell</em> of myrrh, and aloes, <em>and</em> cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.
Psa45:9 Kings' daughters <em>were</em> among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
Psa45:10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
Psa45:11 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he <em>is</em> thy Lord; and worship thou him.
Psa45:12 And the daughter of Tyre <em>shall be there</em> with a gift; <em>even</em> the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.
Psa45:13 The king's daughter <em>is</em> all glorious within: her clothing <em>is</em> of wrought gold.
Psa45:14 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
Psa45:15 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.
Psa45:16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.
Psa45:17 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
Psa46:1 <<To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon Alamoth.>> God <em>is</em> our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
Psa46:2 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
Psa46:3 <em>Though</em> the waters thereof roar <em>and</em> be troubled, <em>though</em> the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.
Psa46:4 <em>There is</em> a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy <em>place</em> of the tabernacles of the most High.
Psa46:5 God <em>is</em> in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, <em>and that</em> right early.
Psa46:6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
Psa46:7 The LORD of hosts <em>is</em> with us; the God of Jacob <em>is</em> our refuge. Selah.
Psa46:8 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.
Psa46:9 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.
Psa46:10 [[Be still, and know that I <em>am</em> God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.]]
Psa46:11 The LORD of hosts <em>is</em> with us; the God of Jacob <em>is</em> our refuge. Selah.
Psa47:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.>> O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
Psa47:2 For the LORD most high <em>is</em> terrible; <em>he is</em> a great King over all the earth.
Psa47:3 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.
Psa47:4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
Psa47:5 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.
Psa47:6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
Psa47:7 For God <em>is</em> the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
Psa47:8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.
Psa47:9 The princes of the people are gathered together, <em>even</em> the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth <em>belong</em> unto God: he is greatly exalted.
Psa48:1 <<A Song <em>and</em> Psalm for the sons of Korah.>> Great <em>is</em> the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, <em>in</em> the mountain of his holiness.
Psa48:2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, <em>is</em> mount Zion, <em>on</em> the sides of the north, the city of the great King.
Psa48:3 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.
Psa48:4 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.
Psa48:5 They saw <em>it, and</em> so they marvelled; they were troubled, <em>and</em> hasted away.
Psa48:6 Fear took hold upon them there, <em>and</em> pain, as of a woman in travail.
Psa48:7 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
Psa48:8 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.
Psa48:9 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.
Psa48:10 According to thy name, O God, so <em>is</em> thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.
Psa48:11 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.
Psa48:12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.
Psa48:13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell <em>it</em> to the generation following.
Psa48:14 For this God <em>is</em> our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide <em>even</em> unto death.
Psa49:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.>> Hear this, all <em>ye</em> people; give ear, all <em>ye</em> inhabitants of the world:
Psa49:2 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
Psa49:3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart <em>shall be</em> of understanding.
Psa49:4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
Psa49:5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, <em>when</em> the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
Psa49:6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
Psa49:7 None <em>of them</em> can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:
Psa49:8 (For the redemption of their soul <em>is</em> precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)
Psa49:9 That he should still live for ever, <em>and</em> not see corruption.
Psa49:10 For he seeth <em>that</em> wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
Psa49:11 Their inward thought <em>is, that</em> their houses <em>shall continue</em> for ever, <em>and</em> their dwelling places to all generations; they call <em>their</em> lands after their own names.
Psa49:12 Nevertheless man <em>being</em> in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts <em>that</em> perish.
Psa49:13 This their way <em>is</em> their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
Psa49:14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
Psa49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.
Psa49:16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
Psa49:17 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
Psa49:18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and <em>men</em> will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.
Psa49:19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.
Psa49:20 Man <em>that is</em> in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts <em>that</em> perish.
Psa50:1 <<A Psalm of Asaph.>> The mighty God, <em>even</em> the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
Psa50:2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
Psa50:3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
Psa50:4 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.
Psa50:5 [[Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.]]
Psa50:6 [[And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God <em>is</em> judge himself. Selah.]]
Psa50:7 [[Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I <em>am</em> God, <em>even</em> thy God.]]
Psa50:8 [[I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, <em>to have been</em> continually before me.]]
Psa50:9 [[I will take no bullock out of thy house, <em>nor</em> he goats out of thy folds.]]
Psa50:10 [[For every beast of the forest <em>is</em> mine, <em>and</em> the cattle upon a thousand hills.]]
Psa50:11 [[I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field <em>are</em> mine.]]
Psa50:12 [[If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world <em>is</em> mine, and the fulness thereof.]]
Psa50:13 [[Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?]]
Psa50:14 [[Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:]]
Psa50:15 [[And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.]]
Psa50:16 [[But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or <em>that</em> thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?]]
Psa50:17 [[Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.]]
Psa50:18 [[When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.]]
Psa50:19 [[Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.]]
Psa50:20 [[Thou sittest <em>and</em> speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.]]
Psa50:21 [[These <em>things</em> hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether <em>such an one</em> as thyself: <em>but</em> I will reprove thee, and set <em>them</em> in order before thine eyes.]]
Psa50:22 [[Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear <em>you</em> in pieces, and <em>there be</em> none to deliver.]]
Psa50:23 [[Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth <em>his</em> conversation <em>aright</em> will I shew the salvation of God.]]
Psa51:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.>> Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
Psa51:2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
Psa51:3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin <em>is</em> ever before me.
Psa51:4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done <em>this</em> evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, <em>and</em> be clear when thou judgest.
Psa51:5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
Psa51:6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden <em>part</em> thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
Psa51:7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
Psa51:8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; <em>that</em> the bones <em>which</em> thou hast broken may rejoice.
Psa51:9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
Psa51:10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
Psa51:11 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
Psa51:12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me <em>with thy</em> free spirit.
Psa51:13 <em>Then</em> will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
Psa51:14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: <em>and</em> my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
Psa51:15 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.
Psa51:16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give <em>it</em>: thou delightest not in burnt offering.
Psa51:17 The sacrifices of God <em>are</em> a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
Psa51:18 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Psa51:19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
Psa52:1 <<To the chief Musician, Maschil, (A Psalm) of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Ahimelech.>> Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God <em>endureth</em> continually.
Psa52:2 Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp rasor, working deceitfully.
Psa52:3 Thou lovest evil more than good; <em>and</em> lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.
Psa52:4 Thou lovest all devouring words, O <em>thou</em> deceitful tongue.
Psa52:5 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of <em>thy</em> dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.
Psa52:6 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:
Psa52:7 Lo, <em>this is</em> the man <em>that</em> made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, <em>and</em> strengthened himself in his wickedness.
Psa52:8 But I <em>am</em> like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
Psa52:9 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done <em>it</em>: and I will wait on thy name; for <em>it is</em> good before thy saints.
Psa53:1 <<To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, (A Psalm) of David.>> The fool hath said in his heart, <em>There is</em> no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: <em>there is</em> none that doeth good.
Psa53:2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were <em>any</em> that did understand, that did seek God.
Psa53:3 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; <em>there is</em> none that doeth good, no, not one.
Psa53:4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people <em>as</em> they eat bread: they have not called upon God.
Psa53:5 There were they in great fear, <em>where</em> no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth <em>against</em> thee: thou hast put <em>them</em> to shame, because God hath despised them.
Psa53:6 Oh that the salvation of Israel <em>were come</em> out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, <em>and</em> Israel shall be glad.
Psa54:1 <<To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, (A Psalm) of David, when the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us?>> Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
Psa54:2 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
Psa54:3 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.
Psa54:4 Behold, God <em>is</em> mine helper: the Lord <em>is</em> with them that uphold my soul.
Psa54:5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.
Psa54:6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for <em>it is</em> good.
Psa54:7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen <em>his desire</em> upon mine enemies.
Psa55:1 <<To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, (A Psalm) of David.>> Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.
Psa55:2 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
Psa55:3 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
Psa55:4 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
Psa55:5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.
Psa55:6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! <em>for then</em> would I fly away, and be at rest.
Psa55:7 Lo, <em>then</em> would I wander far off, <em>and</em> remain in the wilderness. Selah.
Psa55:8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm <em>and</em> tempest.
Psa55:9 Destroy, O Lord, <em>and</em> divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
Psa55:10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow <em>are</em> in the midst of it.
Psa55:11 Wickedness <em>is</em> in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.
Psa55:12 For <em>it was</em> not an enemy <em>that</em> reproached me; then I could have borne <em>it</em>: neither <em>was it</em> he that hated me <em>that</em> did magnify <em>himself</em> against me; then I would have hid myself from him:
Psa55:13 But <em>it was</em> thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.
Psa55:14 We took sweet counsel together, <em>and</em> walked unto the house of God in company.
Psa55:15 Let death seize upon them, <em>and</em> let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness <em>is</em> in their dwellings, <em>and</em> among them.
Psa55:16 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.
Psa55:17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.
Psa55:18 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle <em>that was</em> against me: for there were many with me.
Psa55:19 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
Psa55:20 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.
Psa55:21 <em>The words</em> of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war <em>was</em> in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet <em>were</em> they drawn swords.
Psa55:22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
Psa55:23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
Psa56:1 <<To the chief Musician upon Jonathelemrechokim, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath.>> Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.
Psa56:2 Mine enemies would daily swallow <em>me</em> up: for <em>they be</em> many that fight against me, O thou most High.
Psa56:3 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
Psa56:4 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
Psa56:5 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts <em>are</em> against me for evil.
Psa56:6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.
Psa56:7 Shall they escape by iniquity? in <em>thine</em> anger cast down the people, O God.
Psa56:8 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: <em>are they</em> not in thy book?
Psa56:9 When I cry <em>unto thee</em>, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God <em>is</em> for me.
Psa56:10 In God will I praise <em>his</em> word: in the LORD will I praise <em>his</em> word.
Psa56:11 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
Psa56:12 Thy vows <em>are</em> upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.
Psa56:13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: <em>wilt</em> not <em>thou deliver</em> my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
Psa57:1 <<To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave.>> Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until <em>these</em> calamities be overpast.
Psa57:2 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth <em>all things</em> for me.
Psa57:3 He shall send from heaven, and save me <em>from</em> the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.
Psa57:4 My soul <em>is</em> among lions: <em>and</em> I lie <em>even among</em> them that are set on fire, <em>even</em> the sons of men, whose teeth <em>are</em> spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Psa57:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; <em>let</em> thy glory <em>be</em> above all the earth.
Psa57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen <em>themselves</em>. Selah.
Psa57:7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.
Psa57:8 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I <em>myself</em> will awake early.
Psa57:9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.
Psa57:10 For thy mercy <em>is</em> great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.
Psa57:11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: <em>let</em> thy glory <em>be</em> above all the earth.
Psa58:1 <<To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David.>> Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
Psa58:2 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
Psa58:3 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.
Psa58:4 Their poison <em>is</em> like the poison of a serpent: <em>they are</em> like the deaf adder <em>that</em> stoppeth her ear;
Psa58:5 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
Psa58:6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.
Psa58:7 Let them melt away as waters <em>which</em> run continually: <em>when</em> he bendeth <em>his bow to shoot</em> his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
Psa58:8 As a snail <em>which</em> melteth, let <em>every one of them</em> pass away: <em>like</em> the untimely birth of a woman, <em>that</em> they may not see the sun.
Psa58:9 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in <em>his</em> wrath.
Psa58:10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
Psa58:11 So that a man shall say, Verily <em>there is</em> a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
Psa59:1 <<To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.>> Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.
Psa59:2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
Psa59:3 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not <em>for</em> my transgression, nor <em>for</em> my sin, O LORD.
Psa59:4 They run and prepare themselves without <em>my</em> fault: awake to help me, and behold.
Psa59:5 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.
Psa59:6 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
Psa59:7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords <em>are</em> in their lips: for who, <em>say they</em>, doth hear?
Psa59:8 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.
Psa59:9 <em>Because of</em> his strength will I wait upon thee: for God <em>is</em> my defence.
Psa59:10 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see <em>my desire</em> upon mine enemies.
Psa59:11 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
Psa59:12 <em>For</em> the sin of their mouth <em>and</em> the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying <em>which</em> they speak.
Psa59:13 Consume <em>them</em> in wrath, consume <em>them</em>, that they <em>may</em> not <em>be</em>: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.
Psa59:14 And at evening let them return; <em>and</em> let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
Psa59:15 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.
Psa59:16 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.
Psa59:17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God <em>is</em> my defence, <em>and</em> the God of my mercy.
Psa60:1 <<To the chief Musician upon Shushaneduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aramnaharaim and with Aramzobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand.>> O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.
Psa60:2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
Psa60:3 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.
Psa60:4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
Psa60:5 That thy beloved may be delivered; save <em>with</em> thy right hand, and hear me.
Psa60:6 God hath spoken in his holiness; [[I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.]]
Psa60:7 [[Gilead <em>is</em> mine, and Manasseh <em>is</em> mine; Ephraim also <em>is</em> the strength of mine head; Judah <em>is</em> my lawgiver;]]
Psa60:8 [[Moab <em>is</em> my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.]]
Psa60:9 Who will bring me <em>into</em> the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
Psa60:10 <em>Wilt</em> not thou, O God, <em>which</em> hadst cast us off? and <em>thou</em>, O God, <em>which</em> didst not go out with our armies?
Psa60:11 Give us help from trouble: for vain <em>is</em> the help of man.
Psa60:12 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he <em>it is that</em> shall tread down our enemies.
Psa61:1 <<To the chief Musician upon Neginah, (A Psalm) of David.>> Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
Psa61:2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock <em>that</em> is higher than I.
Psa61:3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, <em>and</em> a strong tower from the enemy.
Psa61:4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.
Psa61:5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given <em>me</em> the heritage of those that fear thy name.
Psa61:6 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: <em>and</em> his years as many generations.
Psa61:7 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, <em>which</em> may preserve him.
Psa61:8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
Psa62:1 <<To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.>> Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him <em>cometh</em> my salvation.
Psa62:2 He only <em>is</em> my rock and my salvation; <em>he is</em> my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
Psa62:3 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall <em>shall ye be, and as</em> a tottering fence.
Psa62:4 They only consult to cast <em>him</em> down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.
Psa62:5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation <em>is</em> from him.
Psa62:6 He only <em>is</em> my rock and my salvation: <em>he is</em> my defence; I shall not be moved.
Psa62:7 In God <em>is</em> my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, <em>and</em> my refuge, <em>is</em> in God.
Psa62:8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God <em>is</em> a refuge for us. Selah.
Psa62:9 Surely men of low degree <em>are</em> vanity, <em>and</em> men of high degree <em>are</em> a lie: to be laid in the balance, they <em>are</em> altogether <em>lighter</em> than vanity.
Psa62:10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart <em>upon them</em>.
Psa62:11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power <em>belongeth</em> unto God.
Psa62:12 Also unto thee, O Lord, <em>belongeth</em> mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
Psa63:1 <<A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.>> O God, thou <em>art</em> my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;
Psa63:2 To see thy power and thy glory, so <em>as</em> I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
Psa63:3 Because thy lovingkindness <em>is</em> better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
Psa63:4 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.
Psa63:5 My soul shall be satisfied as <em>with</em> marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise <em>thee</em> with joyful lips:
Psa63:6 When I remember thee upon my bed, <em>and</em> meditate on thee in the <em>night</em> watches.
Psa63:7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
Psa63:8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.
Psa63:9 But those <em>that</em> seek my soul, to destroy <em>it</em>, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
Psa63:10 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.
Psa63:11 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
Psa64:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.>> Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Psa64:2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:
Psa64:3 Who whet their tongue like a sword, <em>and</em> bend <em>their bows to shoot</em> their arrows, <em>even</em> bitter words:
Psa64:4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
Psa64:5 They encourage themselves <em>in</em> an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?
Psa64:6 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward <em>thought</em> of every one <em>of them</em>, and the heart, <em>is</em> deep.
Psa64:7 But God shall shoot at them <em>with</em> an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.
Psa64:8 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.
Psa64:9 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.
Psa64:10 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
Psa65:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm <em>and</em> Song of David.>> Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.
Psa65:2 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
Psa65:3 Iniquities prevail against me: <em>as for</em> our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.
Psa65:4 Blessed <em>is the man whom</em> thou choosest, and causest to approach <em>unto thee, that</em> he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, <em>even</em> of thy holy temple.
Psa65:5 <em>By</em> terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; <em>who art</em> the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off <em>upon</em> the sea:
Psa65:6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; <em>being</em> girded with power:
Psa65:7 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.
Psa65:8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
Psa65:9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, <em>which</em> is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.
Psa65:10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.
Psa65:11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.
Psa65:12 They drop <em>upon</em> the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.
Psa65:13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
Psa66:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Song <em>or</em> Psalm.>> Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:
Psa66:2 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.
Psa66:3 Say unto God, How terrible <em>art thou in</em> thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
Psa66:4 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing <em>to</em> thy name. Selah.
Psa66:5 Come and see the works of God: <em>he is</em> terrible <em>in his</em> doing toward the children of men.
Psa66:6 He turned the sea into dry <em>land</em>: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
Psa66:7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
Psa66:8 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:
Psa66:9 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.
Psa66:10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
Psa66:11 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.
Psa66:12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy <em>place</em>.
Psa66:13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,
Psa66:14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.
Psa66:15 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.
Psa66:16 Come <em>and</em> hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
Psa66:17 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
Psa66:18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear <em>me</em>:
Psa66:19 <em>But</em> verily God hath heard <em>me</em>; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
Psa66:20 Blessed <em>be</em> God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
Psa67:1 <<To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm <em>or</em> Song.>> God be merciful unto us, and bless us; <em>and</em> cause his face to shine upon us; Selah.
Psa67:2 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.
Psa67:3 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
Psa67:4 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.
Psa67:5 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
Psa67:6 <em>Then</em> shall the earth yield her increase; <em>and</em> God, <em>even</em> our own God, shall bless us.
Psa67:7 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
Psa68:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm <em>or</em> Song of David.>> Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.
Psa68:2 As smoke is driven away, <em>so</em> drive <em>them</em> away: as wax melteth before the fire, <em>so</em> let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
Psa68:3 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.
Psa68:4 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.
Psa68:5 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, <em>is</em> God in his holy habitation.
Psa68:6 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry <em>land</em>.
Psa68:7 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:
Psa68:8 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: <em>even</em> Sinai itself <em>was moved</em> at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
Psa68:9 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.
Psa68:10 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.
Psa68:11 The Lord gave the word: great <em>was</em> the company of those that published <em>it</em>.
Psa68:12 [[Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.]]
Psa68:13 [[Though ye have lien among the pots, <em>yet shall ye be as</em> the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.]]
Psa68:14 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was <em>white</em> as snow in Salmon.
Psa68:15 The hill of God <em>is as</em> the hill of Bashan; an high hill <em>as</em> the hill of Bashan.
Psa68:16 Why leap ye, ye high hills? <em>this is</em> the hill <em>which</em> God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell <em>in it</em> for ever.
Psa68:17 The chariots of God <em>are</em> twenty thousand, <em>even</em> thousands of angels: the Lord <em>is</em> among them, <em>as in</em> Sinai, in the holy <em>place</em>.
Psa68:18 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, <em>for</em> the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell <em>among them</em>.
Psa68:19 Blessed <em>be</em> the Lord, <em>who</em> daily loadeth us <em>with benefits, even</em> the God of our salvation. Selah.
Psa68:20 <em>He that is</em> our God <em>is</em> the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord <em>belong</em> the issues from death.
Psa68:21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, <em>and</em> the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.
Psa68:22 The Lord said, [[I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring <em>my people</em> again from the depths of the sea:]]
Psa68:23 [[That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of <em>thine</em> enemies, <em>and</em> the tongue of thy dogs in the same.]]
Psa68:24 They have seen thy goings, O God; <em>even</em> the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.
Psa68:25 The singers went before, the players on instruments <em>followed</em> after; among <em>them were</em> the damsels playing with timbrels.
Psa68:26 Bless ye God in the congregations, <em>even</em> the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.
Psa68:27 There <em>is</em> little Benjamin <em>with</em> their ruler, the princes of Judah <em>and</em> their council, the princes of Zebulun, <em>and</em> the princes of Naphtali.
Psa68:28 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.
Psa68:29 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.
Psa68:30 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, <em>till every one</em> submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people <em>that</em> delight in war.
Psa68:31 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.
Psa68:32 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:
Psa68:33 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, <em>which were</em> of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, <em>and that</em> a mighty voice.
Psa68:34 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency <em>is</em> over Israel, and his strength <em>is</em> in the clouds.
Psa68:35 O God, <em>thou art</em> terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel <em>is</em> he that giveth strength and power unto <em>his</em> people. Blessed <em>be</em> God.
Psa69:1 <<To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, (A Psalm) of David.>> Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto <em>my</em> soul.
Psa69:2 I sink in deep mire, where <em>there is</em> no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
Psa69:3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
Psa69:4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, <em>being</em> mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored <em>that</em> which I took not away.
Psa69:5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.
Psa69:6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
Psa69:7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
Psa69:8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.
Psa69:9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
Psa69:10 When I wept, <em>and chastened</em> my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.
Psa69:11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
Psa69:12 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I <em>was</em> the song of the drunkards.
Psa69:13 But as for me, my prayer <em>is</em> unto thee, O LORD, <em>in</em> an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.
Psa69:14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Psa69:15 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Psa69:16 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness <em>is</em> good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
Psa69:17 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.
Psa69:18 Draw nigh unto my soul, <em>and</em> redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.
Psa69:19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries <em>are</em> all before thee.
Psa69:20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked <em>for some</em> to take pity, but <em>there was</em> none; and for comforters, but I found none.
Psa69:21 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
Psa69:22 Let their table become a snare before them: and <em>that which should have been</em> for <em>their</em> welfare, <em>let it become</em> a trap.
Psa69:23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.
Psa69:24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
Psa69:25 Let their habitation be desolate; <em>and</em> let none dwell in their tents.
Psa69:26 For they persecute <em>him</em> whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
Psa69:27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.
Psa69:28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.
Psa69:29 But I <em>am</em> poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
Psa69:30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
Psa69:31 <em>This</em> also shall please the LORD better than an ox <em>or</em> bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
Psa69:32 The humble shall see <em>this, and</em> be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.
Psa69:33 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.
Psa69:34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.
Psa69:35 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.
Psa69:36 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
Psa70:1 <<To the chief Musician, (A Psalm) of David, to bring to remembrance.>> <em>Make haste</em>, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.
Psa70:2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
Psa70:3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
Psa70:4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
Psa70:5 But I <em>am</em> poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou <em>art</em> my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
Psa71:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.
Psa71:2 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
Psa71:3 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou <em>art</em> my rock and my fortress.
Psa71:4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
Psa71:5 For thou <em>art</em> my hope, O Lord GOD: <em>thou art</em> my trust from my youth.
Psa71:6 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise <em>shall be</em> continually of thee.
Psa71:7 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou <em>art</em> my strong refuge.
Psa71:8 Let my mouth be filled <em>with</em> thy praise <em>and with</em> thy honour all the day.
Psa71:9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.
Psa71:10 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,
Psa71:11 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for <em>there is</em> none to deliver <em>him</em>.
Psa71:12 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.
Psa71:13 Let them be confounded <em>and</em> consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered <em>with</em> reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.
Psa71:14 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.
Psa71:15 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness <em>and</em> thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers <em>thereof</em>.
Psa71:16 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, <em>even</em> of thine only.
Psa71:17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
Psa71:18 Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto <em>this</em> generation, <em>and</em> thy power to every one <em>that</em> is to come.
Psa71:19 Thy righteousness also, O God, <em>is</em> very high, who hast done great things: O God, who <em>is</em> like unto thee!
Psa71:20 <em>Thou</em>, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
Psa71:21 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
Psa71:22 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, <em>even</em> thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.
Psa71:23 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
Psa71:24 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.
Psa72:1 <<(A Psalm) for Solomon.>> Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.
Psa72:2 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.
Psa72:3 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.
Psa72:4 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
Psa72:5 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.
Psa72:6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers <em>that</em> water the earth.
Psa72:7 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.
Psa72:8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
Psa72:9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
Psa72:10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
Psa72:11 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.
Psa72:12 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and <em>him</em> that hath no helper.
Psa72:13 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.
Psa72:14 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.
Psa72:15 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; <em>and</em> daily shall he be praised.
Psa72:16 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and <em>they</em> of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
Psa72:17 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and <em>men</em> shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.
Psa72:18 Blessed <em>be</em> the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.
Psa72:19 And blessed <em>be</em> his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled <em>with</em> his glory; Amen, and Amen.
Psa72:20 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
Psa73:1 <<A Psalm of Asaph.>> Truly God <em>is</em> good to Israel, <em>even</em> to such as are of a clean heart.
Psa73:2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.
Psa73:3 For I was envious at the foolish, <em>when</em> I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
Psa73:4 For <em>there are</em> no bands in their death: but their strength <em>is</em> firm.
Psa73:5 They <em>are</em> not in trouble <em>as other</em> men; neither are they plagued like <em>other</em> men.
Psa73:6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them <em>as</em> a garment.
Psa73:7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.
Psa73:8 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly <em>concerning</em> oppression: they speak loftily.
Psa73:9 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.
Psa73:10 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full <em>cup</em> are wrung out to them.
Psa73:11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?
Psa73:12 Behold, these <em>are</em> the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase <em>in</em> riches.
Psa73:13 Verily I have cleansed my heart <em>in</em> vain, and washed my hands in innocency.
Psa73:14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.
Psa73:15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend <em>against</em> the generation of thy children.
Psa73:16 When I thought to know this, it <em>was</em> too painful for me;
Psa73:17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; <em>then</em> understood I their end.
Psa73:18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.
Psa73:19 How are they <em>brought</em> into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.
Psa73:20 As a dream when <em>one</em> awaketh; <em>so</em>, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.
Psa73:21 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
Psa73:22 So foolish <em>was</em> I, and ignorant: I was <em>as</em> a beast before thee.
Psa73:23 Nevertheless I <em>am</em> continually with thee: thou hast holden <em>me</em> by my right hand.
Psa73:24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me <em>to</em> glory.
Psa73:25 Whom have I in heaven <em>but thee</em>? and <em>there is</em> none upon earth <em>that</em> I desire beside thee.
Psa73:26 My flesh and my heart faileth: <em>but</em> God <em>is</em> the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
Psa73:27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
Psa73:28 But <em>it is</em> good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
Psa74:1 <<Maschil of Asaph.>> O God, why hast thou cast <em>us</em> off for ever? <em>why</em> doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
Psa74:2 Remember thy congregation, <em>which</em> thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, <em>which</em> thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
Psa74:3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; <em>even</em> all <em>that</em> the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
Psa74:4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns <em>for</em> signs.
Psa74:5 <em>A man</em> was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.
Psa74:6 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.
Psa74:7 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled <em>by casting down</em> the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.
Psa74:8 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
Psa74:9 We see not our signs: <em>there is</em> no more any prophet: neither <em>is there</em> among us any that knoweth how long.
Psa74:10 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
Psa74:11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck <em>it</em> out of thy bosom.
Psa74:12 For God <em>is</em> my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
Psa74:13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.
Psa74:14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, <em>and</em> gavest him <em>to be</em> meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
Psa74:15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.
Psa74:16 The day <em>is</em> thine, the night also <em>is</em> thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Psa74:17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
Psa74:18 Remember this, <em>that</em> the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and <em>that</em> the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
Psa74:19 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude <em>of the wicked</em>: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
Psa74:20 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
Psa74:21 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.
Psa74:22 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.
Psa74:23 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
Psa75:1 <<To the chief Musician, Altaschith, A Psalm <em>or</em> Song of Asaph.>> Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, <em>unto thee</em> do we give thanks: for <em>that</em> thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.
Psa75:2 [[When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.]]
Psa75:3 [[The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.]]
Psa75:4 [[I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:]]
Psa75:5 [[Lift not up your horn on high: speak <em>not with</em> a stiff neck.]]
Psa75:6 For promotion <em>cometh</em> neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
Psa75:7 But God <em>is</em> the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
Psa75:8 For in the hand of the LORD <em>there is</em> a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring <em>them</em> out, <em>and</em> drink <em>them</em>.
Psa75:9 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
Psa75:10 [[All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; <em>but</em> the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.]]
Psa76:1 <<To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm <em>or</em> Song of Asaph.>> In Judah <em>is</em> God known: his name <em>is</em> great in Israel.
Psa76:2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.
Psa76:3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.
Psa76:4 Thou <em>art</em> more glorious <em>and</em> excellent than the mountains of prey.
Psa76:5 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.
Psa76:6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
Psa76:7 Thou, <em>even</em> thou, <em>art</em> to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
Psa76:8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,
Psa76:9 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
Psa76:10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
Psa76:11 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
Psa76:12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: <em>he is</em> terrible to the kings of the earth.
Psa77:1 <<To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph.>> I cried unto God with my voice, <em>even</em> unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.
Psa77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
Psa77:3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
Psa77:4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
Psa77:5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
Psa77:6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
Psa77:7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
Psa77:8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth <em>his</em> promise fail for evermore?
Psa77:9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
Psa77:10 And I said, This <em>is</em> my infirmity: <em>but I will remember</em> the years of the right hand of the most High.
Psa77:11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
Psa77:12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
Psa77:13 Thy way, O God, <em>is</em> in the sanctuary: who <em>is so</em> great a God as <em>our</em> God?
Psa77:14 Thou <em>art</em> the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
Psa77:15 Thou hast with <em>thine</em> arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
Psa77:16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.
Psa77:17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.
Psa77:18 The voice of thy thunder <em>was</em> in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
Psa77:19 Thy way <em>is</em> in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
Psa77:20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Psa78:1 <<Maschil of Asaph.>> Give ear, O my people, <em>to</em> my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
Psa78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
Psa78:3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
Psa78:4 We will not hide <em>them</em> from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
Psa78:5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
Psa78:6 That the generation to come might know <em>them, even</em> the children <em>which</em> should be born; <em>who</em> should arise and declare <em>them</em> to their children:
Psa78:7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
Psa78:8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation <em>that</em> set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
Psa78:9 The children of Ephraim, <em>being</em> armed, <em>and</em> carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
Psa78:10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
Psa78:11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
Psa78:12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, <em>in</em> the field of Zoan.
Psa78:13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
Psa78:14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
Psa78:15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave <em>them</em> drink as <em>out of</em> the great depths.
Psa78:16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
Psa78:17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
Psa78:18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
Psa78:19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
Psa78:20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
Psa78:21 Therefore the LORD heard <em>this</em>, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
Psa78:22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
Psa78:23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
Psa78:24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
Psa78:25 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
Psa78:26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
Psa78:27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
Psa78:28 And he let <em>it</em> fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
Psa78:29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
Psa78:30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat <em>was</em> yet in their mouths,
Psa78:31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen <em>men</em> of Israel.
Psa78:32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
Psa78:33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
Psa78:34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.
Psa78:35 And they remembered that God <em>was</em> their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
Psa78:36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
Psa78:37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
Psa78:38 But he, <em>being</em> full of compassion, forgave <em>their</em> iniquity, and destroyed <em>them</em> not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
Psa78:39 For he remembered that they <em>were but</em> flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
Psa78:40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, <em>and</em> grieve him in the desert!
Psa78:41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
Psa78:42 They remembered not his hand, <em>nor</em> the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
Psa78:43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:
Psa78:44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
Psa78:45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
Psa78:46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
Psa78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
Psa78:48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
Psa78:49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels <em>among them</em>.
Psa78:50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
Psa78:51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of <em>their</em> strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
Psa78:52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
Psa78:53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
Psa78:54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, <em>even to</em> this mountain, <em>which</em> his right hand had purchased.
Psa78:55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Psa78:56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
Psa78:57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
Psa78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
Psa78:59 When God heard <em>this</em>, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
Psa78:60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent <em>which</em> he placed among men;
Psa78:61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
Psa78:62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
Psa78:63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
Psa78:64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
Psa78:65 Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, <em>and</em> like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
Psa78:66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
Psa78:67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
Psa78:68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
Psa78:69 And he built his sanctuary like high <em>palaces</em>, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
Psa78:70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
Psa78:71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
Psa78:72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
Psa79:1 <<A Psalm of Asaph.>> O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
Psa79:2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given <em>to be</em> meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
Psa79:3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and <em>there was</em> none to bury <em>them</em>.
Psa79:4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
Psa79:5 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
Psa79:6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
Psa79:7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
Psa79:8 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
Psa79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
Psa79:10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where <em>is</em> their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight <em>by</em> the revenging of the blood of thy servants <em>which is</em> shed.
Psa79:11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
Psa79:12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
Psa79:13 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
Psa80:1 <<To the chief Musician upon ShoshannimEduth, A Psalm of Asaph.>> Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest <em>between</em> the cherubims, shine forth.
Psa80:2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come <em>and</em> save us.
Psa80:3 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Psa80:4 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
Psa80:5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
Psa80:6 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
Psa80:7 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Psa80:8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
Psa80:9 Thou preparedst <em>room</em> before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
Psa80:10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof <em>were like</em> the goodly cedars.
Psa80:11 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.
Psa80:12 Why hast thou <em>then</em> broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
Psa80:13 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
Psa80:14 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
Psa80:15 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch <em>that</em> thou madest strong for thyself.
Psa80:16 <em>It is</em> burned with fire, <em>it is</em> cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
Psa80:17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man <em>whom</em> thou madest strong for thyself.
Psa80:18 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
Psa80:19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Psa81:1 <<To the chief Musician upon Gittith, (A Psalm) of Asaph.>> Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
Psa81:2 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
Psa81:3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
Psa81:4 For this <em>was</em> a statute for Israel, <em>and</em> a law of the God of Jacob.
Psa81:5 This he ordained in Joseph <em>for</em> a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: <em>where</em> I heard a language <em>that</em> I understood not.
Psa81:6 [[I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.]]
Psa81:7 [[Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah.]] Selah.
Psa81:8 [[Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;]]
Psa81:9 [[There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.]]
Psa81:10 [[I <em>am</em> the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.]]
Psa81:11 [[But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.]]
Psa81:12 [[So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: <em>and</em> they walked in their own counsels.]]
Psa81:13 [[Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, <em>and</em> Israel had walked in my ways!]]
Psa81:14 [[I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.]]
Psa81:15 [[The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.]]
Psa81:16 [[He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.]]
Psa82:1 <<A Psalm of Asaph.>> God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
Psa82:2 [[How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked?]] Selah.
Psa82:3 [[Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.]]
Psa82:4 [[Deliver the poor and needy: rid <em>them</em> out of the hand of the wicked.]]
Psa82:5 [[They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.]]
Psa82:6 [[I have said, Ye <em>are</em> gods; and all of you <em>are</em> children of the most High.]]
Psa82:7 [[But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.]]
Psa82:8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
Psa83:1 <<A Song <em>or</em> Psalm of Asaph.>> Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
Psa83:2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
Psa83:3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
Psa83:4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from <em>being</em> a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
Psa83:5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:
Psa83:6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;
Psa83:7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Psa83:8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.
Psa83:9 Do unto them as <em>unto</em> the Midianites; as <em>to</em> Sisera, as <em>to</em> Jabin, at the brook of Kison:
Psa83:10 <em>Which</em> perished at Endor: they became <em>as</em> dung for the earth.
Psa83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
Psa83:12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.
Psa83:13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.
Psa83:14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;
Psa83:15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.
Psa83:16 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.
Psa83:17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
Psa83:18 That <em>men</em> may know that thou, whose name alone <em>is</em> JEHOVAH, <em>art</em> the most high over all the earth.
Psa84:1 <<To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.>> How amiable <em>are</em> thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
Psa84:2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
Psa84:3 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, <em>even</em> thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.
Psa84:4 Blessed <em>are</em> they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.
Psa84:5 Blessed <em>is</em> the man whose strength <em>is</em> in thee; in whose heart <em>are</em> the ways <em>of them</em>.
Psa84:6 <em>Who</em> passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.
Psa84:7 They go from strength to strength, <em>every one of them</em> in Zion appeareth before God.
Psa84:8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
Psa84:9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
Psa84:10 For a day in thy courts <em>is</em> better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
Psa84:11 For the LORD God <em>is</em> a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good <em>thing</em> will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
Psa84:12 O LORD of hosts, blessed <em>is</em> the man that trusteth in thee.
Psa85:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.>> LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
Psa85:2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.
Psa85:3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned <em>thyself</em> from the fierceness of thine anger.
Psa85:4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.
Psa85:5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
Psa85:6 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Psa85:7 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.
Psa85:8 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.
Psa85:9 Surely his salvation <em>is</em> nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.
Psa85:10 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed <em>each other</em>.
Psa85:11 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
Psa85:12 Yea, the LORD shall give <em>that which is</em> good; and our land shall yield her increase.
Psa85:13 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set <em>us</em> in the way of his steps.
Psa86:1 <<A Prayer of David.>> Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I <em>am</em> poor and needy.
Psa86:2 Preserve my soul; for I <em>am</em> holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
Psa86:3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
Psa86:4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
Psa86:5 For thou, Lord, <em>art</em> good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
Psa86:6 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.
Psa86:7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.
Psa86:8 Among the gods <em>there is</em> none like unto thee, O Lord; neither <em>are there any works</em> like unto thy works.
Psa86:9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
Psa86:10 For thou <em>art</em> great, and doest wondrous things: thou <em>art</em> God alone.
Psa86:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.
Psa86:12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
Psa86:13 For great <em>is</em> thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
Psa86:14 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent <em>men</em> have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.
Psa86:15 But thou, O Lord, <em>art</em> a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
Psa86:16 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
Psa86:17 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see <em>it</em>, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
Psa87:1 <<A Psalm <em>or</em> Song for the sons of Korah.>> His foundation <em>is</em> in the holy mountains.
Psa87:2 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Psa87:3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.
Psa87:4 [[I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this <em>man</em> was born there.]]
Psa87:5 [[And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.]]
Psa87:6 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, <em>that</em> this <em>man</em> was born there. Selah.
Psa87:7 As well the singers as the players on instruments <em>shall be there</em>: all my springs <em>are</em> in thee.
Psa88:1 <<A Song <em>or</em> Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician upon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.>> O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day <em>and</em> night before thee:
Psa88:2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
Psa88:3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
Psa88:4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man <em>that hath</em> no strength:
Psa88:5 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
Psa88:6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
Psa88:7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted <em>me</em> with all thy waves. Selah.
Psa88:8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: <em>I am</em> shut up, and I cannot come forth.
Psa88:9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
Psa88:10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise <em>and</em> praise thee? Selah.
Psa88:11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? <em>or</em> thy faithfulness in destruction?
Psa88:12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
Psa88:13 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.
Psa88:14 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? <em>why</em> hidest thou thy face from me?
Psa88:15 I <em>am</em> afflicted and ready to die from <em>my</em> youth up: <em>while</em> I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
Psa88:16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
Psa88:17 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.
Psa88:18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, <em>and</em> mine acquaintance into darkness.
Psa89:1 <<Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.>> I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
Psa89:2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.
Psa89:3 [[I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,]]
Psa89:4 [[Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations.]] Selah.
Psa89:5 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.
Psa89:6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? <em>who</em> among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?
Psa89:7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all <em>them that are</em> about him.
Psa89:8 O LORD God of hosts, who <em>is</em> a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?
Psa89:9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
Psa89:10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
Psa89:11 The heavens <em>are</em> thine, the earth also <em>is</em> thine: <em>as for</em> the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
Psa89:12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
Psa89:13 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, <em>and</em> high is thy right hand.
Psa89:14 Justice and judgment <em>are</em> the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
Psa89:15 Blessed <em>is</em> the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.
Psa89:16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
Psa89:17 For thou <em>art</em> the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
Psa89:18 For the LORD <em>is</em> our defence; and the Holy One of Israel <em>is</em> our king.
Psa89:19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, [[I have laid help upon <em>one that is</em> mighty; I have exalted <em>one</em> chosen out of the people.]]
Psa89:20 [[I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:]]
Psa89:21 [[With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.]]
Psa89:22 [[The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.]]
Psa89:23 [[And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.]]
Psa89:24 [[But my faithfulness and my mercy <em>shall be</em> with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.]]
Psa89:25 [[I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.]]
Psa89:26 [[He shall cry unto me, Thou <em>art</em> my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.]]
Psa89:27 [[Also I will make him <em>my</em> firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.]]
Psa89:28 [[My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.]]
Psa89:29 [[His seed also will I make <em>to endure</em> for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.]]
Psa89:30 [[If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;]]
Psa89:31 [[If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;]]
Psa89:32 [[Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.]]
Psa89:33 [[Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.]]
Psa89:34 [[My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.]]
Psa89:35 [[Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.]]
Psa89:36 [[His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.]]
Psa89:37 [[It shall be established for ever as the moon, and <em>as</em> a faithful witness in heaven.]] Selah.
Psa89:38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
Psa89:39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown <em>by casting it</em> to the ground.
Psa89:40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.
Psa89:41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.
Psa89:42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
Psa89:43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.
Psa89:44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.
Psa89:45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.
Psa89:46 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?
Psa89:47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?
Psa89:48 What man <em>is he that</em> liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.
Psa89:49 Lord, where <em>are</em> thy former lovingkindnesses, <em>which</em> thou swarest unto David in thy truth?
Psa89:50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; <em>how</em> I do bear in my bosom <em>the reproach of</em> all the mighty people;
Psa89:51 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
Psa89:52 Blessed <em>be</em> the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
Psa90:1 <<A Prayer of Moses the man of God.>> Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
Psa90:2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou <em>art</em> God.
Psa90:3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, [[Return, ye children of men.]]
Psa90:4 For a thousand years in thy sight <em>are but</em> as yesterday when it is past, and <em>as</em> a watch in the night.
Psa90:5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are <em>as</em> a sleep: in the morning <em>they are</em> like grass <em>which</em> groweth up.
Psa90:6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
Psa90:7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.
Psa90:8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret <em>sins</em> in the light of thy countenance.
Psa90:9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale <em>that is told</em>.
Psa90:10 The days of our years <em>are</em> threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength <em>they be</em> fourscore years, yet <em>is</em> their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
Psa90:11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, <em>so is</em> thy wrath.
Psa90:12 So teach <em>us</em> to number our days, that we may apply <em>our</em> hearts unto wisdom.
Psa90:13 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
Psa90:14 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
Psa90:15 Make us glad according to the days <em>wherein</em> thou hast afflicted us, <em>and</em> the years <em>wherein</em> we have seen evil.
Psa90:16 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.
Psa90:17 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
Psa91:1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
Psa91:2 I will say of the LORD, <em>He is</em> my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.
Psa91:3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, <em>and</em> from the noisome pestilence.
Psa91:4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth <em>shall be thy</em> shield and buckler.
Psa91:5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; <em>nor</em> for the arrow <em>that</em> flieth by day;
Psa91:6 <em>Nor</em> for the pestilence <em>that</em> walketh in darkness; <em>nor</em> for the destruction <em>that</em> wasteth at noonday.
Psa91:7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; <em>but</em> it shall not come nigh thee.
Psa91:8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
Psa91:9 Because thou hast made the LORD, <em>which is</em> my refuge, <em>even</em> the most High, thy habitation;
Psa91:10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
Psa91:11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
Psa91:12 They shall bear thee up in <em>their</em> hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Psa91:13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
Psa91:14 [[Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.]]
Psa91:15 [[He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I <em>will be</em> with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.]]
Psa91:16 [[With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.]]
Psa92:1 <<A Psalm <em>or</em> Song for the sabbath day.>> <em>It is a</em> good <em>thing</em> to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:
Psa92:2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
Psa92:3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.
Psa92:4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
Psa92:5 O LORD, how great are thy works! <em>and</em> thy thoughts are very deep.
Psa92:6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
Psa92:7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; <em>it is</em> that they shall be destroyed for ever:
Psa92:8 But thou, LORD, <em>art most</em> high for evermore.
Psa92:9 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
Psa92:10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like <em>the horn of</em> an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
Psa92:11 Mine eye also shall see <em>my desire</em> on mine enemies, <em>and</em> mine ears shall hear <em>my desire</em> of the wicked that rise up against me.
Psa92:12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
Psa92:13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.
Psa92:14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;
Psa92:15 To shew that the LORD <em>is</em> upright: <em>he is</em> my rock, and <em>there is</em> no unrighteousness in him.
Psa93:1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, <em>wherewith</em> he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
Psa93:2 Thy throne <em>is</em> established of old: thou <em>art</em> from everlasting.
Psa93:3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.
Psa93:4 The LORD on high <em>is</em> mightier than the noise of many waters, <em>yea, than</em> the mighty waves of the sea.
Psa93:5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.
Psa94:1 O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.
Psa94:2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.
Psa94:3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
Psa94:4 <em>How long</em> shall they utter <em>and</em> speak hard things? <em>and</em> all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
Psa94:5 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.
Psa94:6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.
Psa94:7 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard <em>it</em>.
Psa94:8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and <em>ye</em> fools, when will ye be wise?
Psa94:9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?
Psa94:10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, <em>shall not he know</em>?
Psa94:11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they <em>are</em> vanity.
Psa94:12 Blessed <em>is</em> the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;
Psa94:13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.
Psa94:14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.
Psa94:15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
Psa94:16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? <em>or</em> who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
Psa94:17 Unless the LORD <em>had been</em> my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.
Psa94:18 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
Psa94:19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.
Psa94:20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?
Psa94:21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
Psa94:22 But the LORD is my defence; and my God <em>is</em> the rock of my refuge.
Psa94:23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; <em>yea</em>, the LORD our God shall cut them off.
Psa95:1 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
Psa95:2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
Psa95:3 For the LORD <em>is</em> a great God, and a great King above all gods.
Psa95:4 In his hand <em>are</em> the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills <em>is</em> his also.
Psa95:5 The sea <em>is</em> his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry <em>land</em>.
Psa95:6 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.
Psa95:7 For he <em>is</em> our God; and we <em>are</em> the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,
Psa95:8 [[Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, <em>and</em> as <em>in</em> the day of temptation in the wilderness:]]
Psa95:9 [[When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.]]
Psa95:10 [[Forty years long was I grieved with <em>this</em> generation, and said, It <em>is</em> a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:]]
Psa95:11 [[Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.]]
Psa96:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.
Psa96:2 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.
Psa96:3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
Psa96:4 For the LORD <em>is</em> great, and greatly to be praised: he <em>is</em> to be feared above all gods.
Psa96:5 For all the gods of the nations <em>are</em> idols: but the LORD made the heavens.
Psa96:6 Honour and majesty <em>are</em> before him: strength and beauty <em>are</em> in his sanctuary.
Psa96:7 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.
Psa96:8 Give unto the LORD the glory <em>due unto</em> his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.
Psa96:9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.
Psa96:10 Say among the heathen <em>that</em> the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.
Psa96:11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.
Psa96:12 Let the field be joyful, and all that <em>is</em> therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
Psa96:13 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
Psa97:1 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad <em>thereof</em>.
Psa97:2 Clouds and darkness <em>are</em> round about him: righteousness and judgment <em>are</em> the habitation of his throne.
Psa97:3 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.
Psa97:4 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.
Psa97:5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
Psa97:6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.
Psa97:7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all <em>ye</em> gods.
Psa97:8 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.
Psa97:9 For thou, LORD, <em>art</em> high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.
Psa97:10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.
Psa97:11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
Psa97:12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
Psa98:1 <<A Psalm.>> O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.
Psa98:2 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.
Psa98:3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Psa98:4 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.
Psa98:5 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.
Psa98:6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.
Psa98:7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
Psa98:8 Let the floods clap <em>their</em> hands: let the hills be joyful together
Psa98:9 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.
Psa99:1 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth <em>between</em> the cherubims; let the earth be moved.
Psa99:2 The LORD <em>is</em> great in Zion; and he <em>is</em> high above all the people.
Psa99:3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; <em>for</em> it <em>is</em> holy.
Psa99:4 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
Psa99:5 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; <em>for</em> he <em>is</em> holy.
Psa99:6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.
Psa99:7 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance <em>that</em> he gave them.
Psa99:8 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.
Psa99:9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God <em>is</em> holy.
Psa100:1 <<A Psalm of praise.>> Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.
Psa100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.
Psa100:3 Know ye that the LORD he <em>is</em> God: <em>it is</em> he <em>that</em> hath made us, and not we ourselves; <em>we are</em> his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
Psa100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, <em>and</em> into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, <em>and</em> bless his name.
Psa100:5 For the LORD <em>is</em> good; his mercy <em>is</em> everlasting; and his truth <em>endureth</em> to all generations.
Psa101:1 <<A Psalm of David.>> I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.
Psa101:2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
Psa101:3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; <em>it</em> shall not cleave to me.
Psa101:4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked <em>person</em>.
Psa101:5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.
Psa101:6 Mine eyes <em>shall be</em> upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
Psa101:7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.
Psa101:8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.
Psa102:1 <<A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD.>> Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.
Psa102:2 Hide not thy face from me in the day <em>when</em> I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day <em>when</em> I call answer me speedily.
Psa102:3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.
Psa102:4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.
Psa102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.
Psa102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.
Psa102:7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
Psa102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; <em>and</em> they that are mad against me are sworn against me.
Psa102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,
Psa102:10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.
Psa102:11 My days <em>are</em> like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.
Psa102:12 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.
Psa102:13 Thou shalt arise, <em>and</em> have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.
Psa102:14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.
Psa102:15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.
Psa102:16 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.
Psa102:17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.
Psa102:18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.
Psa102:19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;
Psa102:20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;
Psa102:21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;
Psa102:22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.
Psa102:23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.
Psa102:24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years <em>are</em> throughout all generations.
Psa102:25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens <em>are</em> the work of thy hands.
Psa102:26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
Psa102:27 But thou <em>art</em> the same, and thy years shall have no end.
Psa102:28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
Psa103:1 <<(A Psalm) of David.>> Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, <em>bless</em> his holy name.
Psa103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
Psa103:3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
Psa103:4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
Psa103:5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good <em>things; so that</em> thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
Psa103:6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.
Psa103:7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
Psa103:8 The LORD <em>is</em> merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
Psa103:9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep <em>his anger</em> for ever.
Psa103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
Psa103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, <em>so</em> great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
Psa103:12 As far as the east is from the west, <em>so</em> far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
Psa103:13 Like as a father pitieth <em>his</em> children, <em>so</em> the LORD pitieth them that fear him.
Psa103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we <em>are</em> dust.
Psa103:15 <em>As for</em> man, his days <em>are</em> as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
Psa103:16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.
Psa103:17 But the mercy of the LORD <em>is</em> from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;
Psa103:18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
Psa103:19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.
Psa103:20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
Psa103:21 Bless ye the LORD, all <em>ye</em> his hosts; <em>ye</em> ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
Psa103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.
Psa104:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.
Psa104:2 Who coverest <em>thyself</em> with light as <em>with</em> a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
Psa104:3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
Psa104:4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
Psa104:5 <em>Who</em> laid the foundations of the earth, <em>that</em> it should not be removed for ever.
Psa104:6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as <em>with</em> a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.
Psa104:7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
Psa104:8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
Psa104:9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.
Psa104:10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, <em>which</em> run among the hills.
Psa104:11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.
Psa104:12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, <em>which</em> sing among the branches.
Psa104:13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
Psa104:14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
Psa104:15 And wine <em>that</em> maketh glad the heart of man, <em>and</em> oil to make <em>his</em> face to shine, and bread <em>which</em> strengtheneth man's heart.
Psa104:16 The trees of the LORD are full <em>of sap</em>; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
Psa104:17 Where the birds make their nests: <em>as for</em> the stork, the fir trees <em>are</em> her house.
Psa104:18 The high hills <em>are</em> a refuge for the wild goats; <em>and</em> the rocks for the conies.
Psa104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.
Psa104:20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep <em>forth</em>.
Psa104:21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.
Psa104:22 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.
Psa104:23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.
Psa104:24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.
Psa104:25 <em>So is</em> this great and wide sea, wherein <em>are</em> things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.
Psa104:26 There go the ships: <em>there is</em> that leviathan, <em>whom</em> thou hast made to play therein.
Psa104:27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give <em>them</em> their meat in due season.
Psa104:28 <em>That</em> thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
Psa104:29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
Psa104:30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.
Psa104:31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.
Psa104:32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
Psa104:33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
Psa104:34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.
Psa104:35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
Psa105:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.
Psa105:2 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.
Psa105:3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
Psa105:4 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Psa105:5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
Psa105:6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.
Psa105:7 He <em>is</em> the LORD our God: his judgments <em>are</em> in all the earth.
Psa105:8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word <em>which</em> he commanded to a thousand generations.
Psa105:9 Which <em>covenant</em> he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
Psa105:10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, <em>and</em> to Israel <em>for</em> an everlasting covenant:
Psa105:11 Saying, [[Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:]]
Psa105:12 When they were <em>but</em> a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.
Psa105:13 When they went from one nation to another, from <em>one</em> kingdom to another people;
Psa105:14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
Psa105:15 <em>Saying</em>, [[Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.]]
Psa105:16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.
Psa105:17 He sent a man before them, <em>even</em> Joseph, <em>who</em> was sold for a servant:
Psa105:18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
Psa105:19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.
Psa105:20 The king sent and loosed him; <em>even</em> the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
Psa105:21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
Psa105:22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
Psa105:23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
Psa105:24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
Psa105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.
Psa105:26 He sent Moses his servant; <em>and</em> Aaron whom he had chosen.
Psa105:27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
Psa105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
Psa105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
Psa105:30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
Psa105:31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, <em>and</em> lice in all their coasts.
Psa105:32 He gave them hail for rain, <em>and</em> flaming fire in their land.
Psa105:33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.
Psa105:34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,
Psa105:35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
Psa105:36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
Psa105:37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and <em>there was</em> not one feeble <em>person</em> among their tribes.
Psa105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.
Psa105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.
Psa105:40 <em>The people</em> asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
Psa105:41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places <em>like</em> a river.
Psa105:42 For he remembered his holy promise, <em>and</em> Abraham his servant.
Psa105:43 And he brought forth his people with joy, <em>and</em> his chosen with gladness:
Psa105:44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;
Psa105:45 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
Psa106:1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for <em>he is</em> good: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa106:2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? <em>who</em> can shew forth all his praise?
Psa106:3 Blessed <em>are</em> they that keep judgment, <em>and</em> he that doeth righteousness at all times.
Psa106:4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour <em>that thou bearest unto</em> thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;
Psa106:5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
Psa106:6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
Psa106:7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked <em>him</em> at the sea, <em>even</em> at the Red sea.
Psa106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
Psa106:9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
Psa106:10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated <em>them</em>, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
Psa106:11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
Psa106:12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
Psa106:13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
Psa106:14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
Psa106:15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
Psa106:16 They envied Moses also in the camp, <em>and</em> Aaron the saint of the LORD.
Psa106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
Psa106:18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
Psa106:19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
Psa106:20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
Psa106:21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;
Psa106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, <em>and</em> terrible things by the Red sea.
Psa106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy <em>them</em>.
Psa106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
Psa106:25 But murmured in their tents, <em>and</em> hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.
Psa106:26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
Psa106:27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
Psa106:28 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
Psa106:29 Thus they provoked <em>him</em> to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
Psa106:30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and <em>so</em> the plague was stayed.
Psa106:31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
Psa106:32 They angered <em>him</em> also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
Psa106:33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Psa106:34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
Psa106:35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
Psa106:36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
Psa106:37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
Psa106:38 And shed innocent blood, <em>even</em> the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
Psa106:39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
Psa106:40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
Psa106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
Psa106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
Psa106:43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked <em>him</em> with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
Psa106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
Psa106:45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
Psa106:46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
Psa106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, <em>and</em> to triumph in thy praise.
Psa106:48 Blessed <em>be</em> the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
Psa107:1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for <em>he is</em> good: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say <em>so</em>, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
Psa107:3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
Psa107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
Psa107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
Psa107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, <em>and</em> he delivered them out of their distresses.
Psa107:7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
Psa107:8 Oh that <em>men</em> would praise the LORD <em>for</em> his goodness, and <em>for</em> his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psa107:9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Psa107:10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, <em>being</em> bound in affliction and iron;
Psa107:11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:
Psa107:12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and <em>there was</em> none to help.
Psa107:13 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, <em>and</em> he saved them out of their distresses.
Psa107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.
Psa107:15 Oh that <em>men</em> would praise the LORD <em>for</em> his goodness, and <em>for</em> his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psa107:16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.
Psa107:17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
Psa107:18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.
Psa107:19 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, <em>and</em> he saveth them out of their distresses.
Psa107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered <em>them</em> from their destructions.
Psa107:21 Oh that <em>men</em> would praise the LORD <em>for</em> his goodness, and <em>for</em> his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psa107:22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.
Psa107:23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;
Psa107:24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
Psa107:25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.
Psa107:26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
Psa107:27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.
Psa107:28 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.
Psa107:29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
Psa107:30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
Psa107:31 Oh that <em>men</em> would praise the LORD <em>for</em> his goodness, and <em>for</em> his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psa107:32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
Psa107:33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;
Psa107:34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Psa107:35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.
Psa107:36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;
Psa107:37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
Psa107:38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
Psa107:39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
Psa107:40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, <em>where there is</em> no way.
Psa107:41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh <em>him</em> families like a flock.
Psa107:42 The righteous shall see <em>it</em>, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
Psa107:43 Whoso <em>is</em> wise, and will observe these <em>things</em>, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.
Psa108:1 <<A Song <em>or</em> Psalm of David.>> O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
Psa108:2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I <em>myself</em> will awake early.
Psa108:3 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
Psa108:4 For thy mercy <em>is</em> great above the heavens: and thy truth <em>reacheth</em> unto the clouds.
Psa108:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;
Psa108:6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save <em>with</em> thy right hand, and answer me.
Psa108:7 God hath spoken in his holiness; [[I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.]]
Psa108:8 [[Gilead <em>is</em> mine; Manasseh <em>is</em> mine; Ephraim also <em>is</em> the strength of mine head; Judah <em>is</em> my lawgiver;]]
Psa108:9 [[Moab <em>is</em> my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.]]
Psa108:10 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
Psa108:11 <em>Wilt</em> not <em>thou</em>, O God, <em>who</em> hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
Psa108:12 Give us help from trouble: for vain <em>is</em> the help of man.
Psa108:13 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he <em>it is that</em> shall tread down our enemies.
Psa109:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.>> Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
Psa109:2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
Psa109:3 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
Psa109:4 For my love they are my adversaries: but I <em>give myself unto</em> prayer.
Psa109:5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
Psa109:6 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.
Psa109:7 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
Psa109:8 Let his days be few; <em>and</em> let another take his office.
Psa109:9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
Psa109:10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek <em>their bread</em> also out of their desolate places.
Psa109:11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.
Psa109:12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.
Psa109:13 Let his posterity be cut off; <em>and</em> in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
Psa109:14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
Psa109:15 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
Psa109:16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
Psa109:17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
Psa109:18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Psa109:19 Let it be unto him as the garment <em>which</em> covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
Psa109:20 <em>Let</em> this <em>be</em> the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.
Psa109:21 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy <em>is</em> good, deliver thou me.
Psa109:22 For I <em>am</em> poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
Psa109:23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
Psa109:24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
Psa109:25 I became also a reproach unto them: <em>when</em> they looked upon me they shaked their heads.
Psa109:26 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
Psa109:27 That they may know that this <em>is</em> thy hand; <em>that</em> thou, LORD, hast done it.
Psa109:28 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
Psa109:29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
Psa109:30 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
Psa109:31 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save <em>him</em> from those that condemn his soul.
Psa110:1 <<A Psalm of David.>> The LORD said unto my Lord, [[Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.]]
Psa110:2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
Psa110:3 Thy people <em>shall be</em> willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.
Psa110:4 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, [[Thou <em>art</em> a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.]]
Psa110:5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
Psa110:6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill <em>the places</em> with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.
Psa110:7 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
Psa111:1 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with <em>my</em> whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and <em>in</em> the congregation.
Psa111:2 The works of the LORD <em>are</em> great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
Psa111:3 His work <em>is</em> honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
Psa111:4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD <em>is</em> gracious and full of compassion.
Psa111:5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.
Psa111:6 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
Psa111:7 The works of his hands <em>are</em> verity and judgment; all his commandments <em>are</em> sure.
Psa111:8 They stand fast for ever and ever, <em>and are</em> done in truth and uprightness.
Psa111:9 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend <em>is</em> his name.
Psa111:10 The fear of the LORD <em>is</em> the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do <em>his commandments</em>: his praise endureth for ever.
Psa112:1 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed <em>is</em> the man <em>that</em> feareth the LORD, <em>that</em> delighteth greatly in his commandments.
Psa112:2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
Psa112:3 Wealth and riches <em>shall be</em> in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
Psa112:4 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: <em>he is</em> gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.
Psa112:5 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.
Psa112:6 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.
Psa112:7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.
Psa112:8 His heart <em>is</em> established, he shall not be afraid, until he see <em>his desire</em> upon his enemies.
Psa112:9 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
Psa112:10 The wicked shall see <em>it</em>, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
Psa113:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.
Psa113:2 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.
Psa113:3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD's name <em>is</em> to be praised.
Psa113:4 The LORD <em>is</em> high above all nations, <em>and</em> his glory above the heavens.
Psa113:5 Who <em>is</em> like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,
Psa113:6 Who humbleth <em>himself</em> to behold <em>the things that are</em> in heaven, and in the earth!
Psa113:7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, <em>and</em> lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
Psa113:8 That he may set <em>him</em> with princes, <em>even</em> with the princes of his people.
Psa113:9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, <em>and to be</em> a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.
Psa114:1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
Psa114:2 Judah was his sanctuary, <em>and</em> Israel his dominion.
Psa114:3 The sea saw <em>it</em>, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
Psa114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, <em>and</em> the little hills like lambs.
Psa114:5 What <em>ailed</em> thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, <em>that</em> thou wast driven back?
Psa114:6 Ye mountains, <em>that</em> ye skipped like rams; <em>and</em> ye little hills, like lambs?
Psa114:7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
Psa114:8 Which turned the rock <em>into</em> a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
Psa115:1 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, <em>and</em> for thy truth's sake.
Psa115:2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where <em>is</em> now their God?
Psa115:3 But our God <em>is</em> in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.
Psa115:4 Their idols <em>are</em> silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
Psa115:5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
Psa115:6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
Psa115:7 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
Psa115:8 They that make them are like unto them; <em>so is</em> every one that trusteth in them.
Psa115:9 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he <em>is</em> their help and their shield.
Psa115:10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he <em>is</em> their help and their shield.
Psa115:11 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he <em>is</em> their help and their shield.
Psa115:12 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless <em>us</em>; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.
Psa115:13 He will bless them that fear the LORD, <em>both</em> small and great.
Psa115:14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.
Psa115:15 Ye <em>are</em> blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.
Psa115:16 The heaven, <em>even</em> the heavens, <em>are</em> the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
Psa115:17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.
Psa115:18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.
Psa116:1 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice <em>and</em> my supplications.
Psa116:2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon <em>him</em> as long as I live.
Psa116:3 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
Psa116:4 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Psa116:5 Gracious <em>is</em> the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God <em>is</em> merciful.
Psa116:6 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.
Psa116:7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.
Psa116:8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, <em>and</em> my feet from falling.
Psa116:9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
Psa116:10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
Psa116:11 I said in my haste, All men <em>are</em> liars.
Psa116:12 What shall I render unto the LORD <em>for</em> all his benefits toward me?
Psa116:13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.
Psa116:14 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.
Psa116:15 Precious in the sight of the LORD <em>is</em> the death of his saints.
Psa116:16 O LORD, truly I <em>am</em> thy servant; I <em>am</em> thy servant, <em>and</em> the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.
Psa116:17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.
Psa116:18 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people,
Psa116:19 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
Psa117:1 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.
Psa117:2 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD <em>endureth</em> for ever. Praise ye the LORD.
Psa118:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; for <em>he is</em> good: because his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa118:2 Let Israel now say, that his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa118:3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa118:4 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa118:5 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, <em>and set me</em> in a large place.
Psa118:6 The LORD <em>is</em> on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?
Psa118:7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see <em>my desire</em> upon them that hate me.
Psa118:8 <em>It is</em> better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.
Psa118:9 <em>It is</em> better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.
Psa118:10 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.
Psa118:11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
Psa118:12 They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
Psa118:13 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.
Psa118:14 The LORD <em>is</em> my strength and song, and is become my salvation.
Psa118:15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation <em>is</em> in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.
Psa118:16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.
Psa118:17 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.
Psa118:18 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.
Psa118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, <em>and</em> I will praise the LORD:
Psa118:20 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.
Psa118:21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.
Psa118:22 The stone <em>which</em> the builders refused is become the head <em>stone</em> of the corner.
Psa118:23 This is the LORD's doing; it <em>is</em> marvellous in our eyes.
Psa118:24 This <em>is</em> the day <em>which</em> the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Psa118:25 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.
Psa118:26 Blessed <em>be</em> he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.
Psa118:27 God <em>is</em> the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, <em>even</em> unto the horns of the altar.
Psa118:28 Thou <em>art</em> my God, and I will praise thee: <em>thou art</em> my God, I will exalt thee.
Psa118:29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for <em>he is</em> good: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa119:1 <<ALEPH.>> Blessed <em>are</em> the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.
Psa119:2 Blessed <em>are</em> they that keep his testimonies, <em>and that</em> seek him with the whole heart.
Psa119:3 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.
Psa119:4 Thou hast commanded <em>us</em> to keep thy precepts diligently.
Psa119:5 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!
Psa119:6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.
Psa119:7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.
Psa119:8 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.
Psa119:9 <<BETH.>> Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed <em>thereto</em> according to thy word.
Psa119:10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.
Psa119:11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.
Psa119:12 Blessed <em>art</em> thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.
Psa119:13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.
Psa119:14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as <em>much as</em> in all riches.
Psa119:15 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.
Psa119:16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.
Psa119:17 <<GIMEL.>> Deal bountifully with thy servant, <em>that</em> I may live, and keep thy word.
Psa119:18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.
Psa119:19 I <em>am</em> a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.
Psa119:20 My soul breaketh for the longing <em>that it hath</em> unto thy judgments at all times.
Psa119:21 Thou hast rebuked the proud <em>that are</em> cursed, which do err from thy commandments.
Psa119:22 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.
Psa119:23 Princes also did sit <em>and</em> speak against me: <em>but</em> thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.
Psa119:24 Thy testimonies also <em>are</em> my delight <em>and</em> my counsellers.
Psa119:25 <<DALETH.>> My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.
Psa119:26 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.
Psa119:27 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.
Psa119:28 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.
Psa119:29 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.
Psa119:30 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid <em>before me</em>.
Psa119:31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.
Psa119:32 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.
Psa119:33 <<HE.>> Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it <em>unto</em> the end.
Psa119:34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with <em>my</em> whole heart.
Psa119:35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.
Psa119:36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.
Psa119:37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; <em>and</em> quicken thou me in thy way.
Psa119:38 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who <em>is devoted</em> to thy fear.
Psa119:39 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments <em>are</em> good.
Psa119:40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.
Psa119:41 <<VAU.>> Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, <em>even</em> thy salvation, according to thy word.
Psa119:42 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.
Psa119:43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.
Psa119:44 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.
Psa119:45 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.
Psa119:46 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.
Psa119:47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.
Psa119:48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.
Psa119:49 <<ZAIN.>> Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.
Psa119:50 This <em>is</em> my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.
Psa119:51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: <em>yet</em> have I not declined from thy law.
Psa119:52 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.
Psa119:53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
Psa119:54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
Psa119:55 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.
Psa119:56 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.
Psa119:57 <<CHETH.>> <em>Thou art</em> my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.
Psa119:58 I intreated thy favour with <em>my</em> whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.
Psa119:59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
Psa119:60 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.
Psa119:61 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: <em>but</em> I have not forgotten thy law.
Psa119:62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.
Psa119:63 I <em>am</em> a companion of all <em>them</em> that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.
Psa119:64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.
Psa119:65 <<TETH.>> Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.
Psa119:66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.
Psa119:67 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.
Psa119:68 Thou <em>art</em> good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.
Psa119:69 The proud have forged a lie against me: <em>but</em> I will keep thy precepts with <em>my</em> whole heart.
Psa119:70 Their heart is as fat as grease; <em>but</em> I delight in thy law.
Psa119:71 <em>It is</em> good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.
Psa119:72 The law of thy mouth <em>is</em> better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.
Psa119:73 <<JOD.>> Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.
Psa119:74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.
Psa119:75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments <em>are</em> right, and <em>that</em> thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.
Psa119:76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.
Psa119:77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law <em>is</em> my delight.
Psa119:78 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: <em>but</em> I will meditate in thy precepts.
Psa119:79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.
Psa119:80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.
Psa119:81 <<CAPH.>> My soul fainteth for thy salvation: <em>but</em> I hope in thy word.
Psa119:82 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?
Psa119:83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; <em>yet</em> do I not forget thy statutes.
Psa119:84 How many <em>are</em> the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
Psa119:85 The proud have digged pits for me, which <em>are</em> not after thy law.
Psa119:86 All thy commandments <em>are</em> faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.
Psa119:87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.
Psa119:88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.
Psa119:89 <<LAMED.>> For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.
Psa119:90 Thy faithfulness <em>is</em> unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.
Psa119:91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all <em>are</em> thy servants.
Psa119:92 Unless thy law <em>had been</em> my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.
Psa119:93 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.
Psa119:94 I <em>am</em> thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.
Psa119:95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: <em>but</em> I will consider thy testimonies.
Psa119:96 I have seen an end of all perfection: <em>but</em> thy commandment <em>is</em> exceeding broad.
Psa119:97 <<MEM.>> O how love I thy law! it <em>is</em> my meditation all the day.
Psa119:98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they <em>are</em> ever with me.
Psa119:99 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies <em>are</em> my meditation.
Psa119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.
Psa119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.
Psa119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.
Psa119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! <em>yea, sweeter</em> than honey to my mouth!
Psa119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.
Psa119:105 <<NUN.>> Thy word <em>is</em> a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
Psa119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform <em>it</em>, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.
Psa119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.
Psa119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.
Psa119:109 My soul <em>is</em> continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.
Psa119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.
Psa119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they <em>are</em> the rejoicing of my heart.
Psa119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, <em>even unto</em> the end.
Psa119:113 <<SAMECH.>> I hate <em>vain</em> thoughts: but thy law do I love.
Psa119:114 Thou <em>art</em> my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.
Psa119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.
Psa119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.
Psa119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.
Psa119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit <em>is</em> falsehood.
Psa119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth <em>like</em> dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.
Psa119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.
Psa119:121 <<AIN.>> I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.
Psa119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.
Psa119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.
Psa119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.
Psa119:125 I <em>am</em> thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.
Psa119:126 <em>It is</em> time for <em>thee</em>, LORD, to work: <em>for</em> they have made void thy law.
Psa119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.
Psa119:128 Therefore I esteem all <em>thy</em> precepts <em>concerning</em> all <em>things to be</em> right; <em>and</em> I hate every false way.
Psa119:129 <<PE.>> Thy testimonies <em>are</em> wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.
Psa119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.
Psa119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.
Psa119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.
Psa119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
Psa119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.
Psa119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.
Psa119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.
Psa119:137 <<TZADDI.>> Righteous <em>art</em> thou, O LORD, and upright <em>are</em> thy judgments.
Psa119:138 Thy testimonies <em>that</em> thou hast commanded <em>are</em> righteous and very faithful.
Psa119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.
Psa119:140 Thy word <em>is</em> very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.
Psa119:141 I <em>am</em> small and despised: <em>yet</em> do not I forget thy precepts.
Psa119:142 Thy righteousness <em>is</em> an everlasting righteousness, and thy law <em>is</em> the truth.
Psa119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: <em>yet</em> thy commandments <em>are</em> my delights.
Psa119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies <em>is</em> everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.
Psa119:145 <<KOPH.>> I cried with <em>my</em> whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.
Psa119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.
Psa119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.
Psa119:148 Mine eyes prevent the <em>night</em> watches, that I might meditate in thy word.
Psa119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.
Psa119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.
Psa119:151 Thou <em>art</em> near, O LORD; and all thy commandments <em>are</em> truth.
Psa119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.
Psa119:153 <<RESH.>> Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.
Psa119:154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.
Psa119:155 Salvation <em>is</em> far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.
Psa119:156 Great <em>are</em> thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.
Psa119:157 Many <em>are</em> my persecutors and mine enemies; <em>yet</em> do I not decline from thy testimonies.
Psa119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.
Psa119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.
Psa119:160 Thy word <em>is</em> true <em>from</em> the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa119:161 <<SCHIN.>> Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.
Psa119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.
Psa119:163 I hate and abhor lying: <em>but</em> thy law do I love.
Psa119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.
Psa119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.
Psa119:166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.
Psa119:167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.
Psa119:168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways <em>are</em> before thee.
Psa119:169 <<TAU.>> Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.
Psa119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.
Psa119:171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.
Psa119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments <em>are</em> righteousness.
Psa119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.
Psa119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law <em>is</em> my delight.
Psa119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.
Psa119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.
Psa120:1 <<A Song of degrees.>> In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.
Psa120:2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, <em>and</em> from a deceitful tongue.
Psa120:3 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?
Psa120:4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
Psa120:5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, <em>that</em> I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
Psa120:6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
Psa120:7 I <em>am for</em> peace: but when I speak, they <em>are</em> for war.
Psa121:1 <<A Song of degrees.>> I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
Psa121:2 My help <em>cometh</em> from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.
Psa121:3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.
Psa121:4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
Psa121:5 The LORD <em>is</em> thy keeper: the LORD <em>is</em> thy shade upon thy right hand.
Psa121:6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
Psa121:7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.
Psa121:8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
Psa122:1 <<A Song of degrees of David.>> I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.
Psa122:2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
Psa122:3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:
Psa122:4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.
Psa122:5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
Psa122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
Psa122:7 Peace be within thy walls, <em>and</em> prosperity within thy palaces.
Psa122:8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace <em>be</em> within thee.
Psa122:9 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
Psa123:1 <<A Song of degrees.>> Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Psa123:2 Behold, as the eyes of servants <em>look</em> unto the hand of their masters, <em>and</em> as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes <em>wait</em> upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
Psa123:3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
Psa123:4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, <em>and</em> with the contempt of the proud.
Psa124:1 <<A Song of degrees of David.>> If <em>it had</em> not <em>been</em> the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;
Psa124:2 If <em>it had</em> not <em>been</em> the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:
Psa124:3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:
Psa124:4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:
Psa124:5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
Psa124:6 Blessed <em>be</em> the LORD, who hath not given us <em>as</em> a prey to their teeth.
Psa124:7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
Psa124:8 Our help <em>is</em> in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
Psa125:1 <<A Song of degrees.>> They that trust in the LORD <em>shall be</em> as mount Zion, <em>which</em> cannot be removed, <em>but</em> abideth for ever.
Psa125:2 <em>As</em> the mountains <em>are</em> round about Jerusalem, so the LORD <em>is</em> round about his people from henceforth even for ever.
Psa125:3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
Psa125:4 Do good, O LORD, unto <em>those that be</em> good, and to <em>them that are</em> upright in their hearts.
Psa125:5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: <em>but</em> peace <em>shall be</em> upon Israel.
Psa126:1 <<A Song of degrees.>> When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
Psa126:2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.
Psa126:3 The LORD hath done great things for us; <em>whereof</em> we are glad.
Psa126:4 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
Psa126:5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
Psa126:6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves <em>with him</em>.
Psa127:1 <<A Song of degrees for Solomon.>> Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh <em>but</em> in vain.
Psa127:2 <em>It is</em> vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: <em>for</em> so he giveth his beloved sleep.
Psa127:3 Lo, children <em>are</em> an heritage of the LORD: <em>and</em> the fruit of the womb <em>is his</em> reward.
Psa127:4 As arrows <em>are</em> in the hand of a mighty man; so <em>are</em> children of the youth.
Psa127:5 Happy <em>is</em> the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
Psa128:1 <<A Song of degrees.>> Blessed <em>is</em> every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.
Psa128:2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy <em>shalt</em> thou <em>be</em>, and <em>it shall be</em> well with thee.
Psa128:3 Thy wife <em>shall be</em> as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
Psa128:4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.
Psa128:5 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
Psa128:6 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, <em>and</em> peace upon Israel.
Psa129:1 <<A Song of degrees.>> Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:
Psa129:2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.
Psa129:3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.
Psa129:4 The LORD <em>is</em> righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
Psa129:5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
Psa129:6 Let them be as the grass <em>upon</em> the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:
Psa129:7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
Psa129:8 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD <em>be</em> upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
Psa130:1 <<A Song of degrees.>> Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.
Psa130:2 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
Psa130:3 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
Psa130:4 But <em>there is</em> forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
Psa130:5 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.
Psa130:6 My soul <em>waiteth</em> for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: <em>I say, more than</em> they that watch for the morning.
Psa130:7 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD <em>there is</em> mercy, and with him <em>is</em> plenteous redemption.
Psa130:8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
Psa131:1 <<A Song of degrees of David.>> LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.
Psa131:2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul <em>is</em> even as a weaned child.
Psa131:3 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
Psa132:1 <<A Song of degrees.>> LORD, remember David, <em>and</em> all his afflictions:
Psa132:2 How he sware unto the LORD, <em>and</em> vowed unto the mighty <em>God</em> of Jacob;
Psa132:3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;
Psa132:4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, <em>or</em> slumber to mine eyelids,
Psa132:5 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty <em>God</em> of Jacob.
Psa132:6 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.
Psa132:7 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.
Psa132:8 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Psa132:9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.
Psa132:10 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.
Psa132:11 The LORD hath sworn <em>in</em> truth unto David; he will not turn from it; [[Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.]]
Psa132:12 [[If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.]]
Psa132:13 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired <em>it</em> for his habitation.
Psa132:14 [[This <em>is</em> my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.]]
Psa132:15 [[I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.]]
Psa132:16 [[I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.]]
Psa132:17 [[There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.]]
Psa132:18 [[His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.]]
Psa133:1 <<A Song of degrees of David.>> Behold, how good and how pleasant <em>it is</em> for brethren to dwell together in unity!
Psa133:2 <em>It is</em> like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, <em>even</em> Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;
Psa133:3 As the dew of Hermon, <em>and as the dew</em> that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, <em>even</em> life for evermore.
Psa134:1 <<A Song of degrees.>> Behold, bless ye the LORD, all <em>ye</em> servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.
Psa134:2 Lift up your hands <em>in</em> the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.
Psa134:3 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.
Psa135:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise <em>him</em>, O ye servants of the LORD.
Psa135:2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God,
Psa135:3 Praise the LORD; for the LORD <em>is</em> good: sing praises unto his name; for <em>it is</em> pleasant.
Psa135:4 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, <em>and</em> Israel for his peculiar treasure.
Psa135:5 For I know that the LORD <em>is</em> great, and <em>that</em> our Lord <em>is</em> above all gods.
Psa135:6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, <em>that</em> did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.
Psa135:7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.
Psa135:8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
Psa135:9 <em>Who</em> sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
Psa135:10 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
Psa135:11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:
Psa135:12 And gave their land <em>for</em> an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.
Psa135:13 Thy name, O LORD, <em>endureth</em> for ever; <em>and</em> thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.
Psa135:14 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.
Psa135:15 The idols of the heathen <em>are</em> silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
Psa135:16 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
Psa135:17 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there <em>any</em> breath in their mouths.
Psa135:18 They that make them are like unto them: <em>so is</em> every one that trusteth in them.
Psa135:19 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:
Psa135:20 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.
Psa135:21 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
Psa136:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; for <em>he is</em> good: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa136:2 O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa136:3 O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa136:4 To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa136:5 To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa136:6 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa136:7 To him that made great lights: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever:
Psa136:8 The sun to rule by day: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever:
Psa136:9 The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa136:10 To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever:
Psa136:11 And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever:
Psa136:12 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa136:13 To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever:
Psa136:14 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever:
Psa136:15 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa136:16 To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa136:17 To him which smote great kings: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever:
Psa136:18 And slew famous kings: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever:
Psa136:19 Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever:
Psa136:20 And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever:
Psa136:21 And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever:
Psa136:22 <em>Even</em> an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa136:23 Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever:
Psa136:24 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa136:25 Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa136:26 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever.
Psa137:1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
Psa137:2 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
Psa137:3 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us <em>required of us</em> mirth, <em>saying</em>, Sing us <em>one</em> of the songs of Zion.
Psa137:4 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?
Psa137:5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget <em>her cunning</em>.
Psa137:6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.
Psa137:7 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase <em>it</em>, rase <em>it, even</em> to the foundation thereof.
Psa137:8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy <em>shall he be</em>, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
Psa137:9 Happy <em>shall he be</em>, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
Psa138:1 <<(A Psalm) of David.>> I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.
Psa138:2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
Psa138:3 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, <em>and</em> strengthenedst me <em>with</em> strength in my soul.
Psa138:4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.
Psa138:5 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great <em>is</em> the glory of the LORD.
Psa138:6 Though the LORD <em>be</em> high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.
Psa138:7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.
Psa138:8 The LORD will perfect <em>that which</em> concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, <em>endureth</em> for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.
Psa139:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.>> O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known <em>me</em>.
Psa139:2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
Psa139:3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted <em>with</em> all my ways.
Psa139:4 For <em>there is</em> not a word in my tongue, <em>but</em>, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
Psa139:5 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.
Psa139:6 <em>Such</em> knowledge <em>is</em> too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot <em>attain</em> unto it.
Psa139:7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
Psa139:8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou <em>art</em> there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou <em>art there</em>.
Psa139:9 <em>If</em> I take the wings of the morning, <em>and</em> dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
Psa139:10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
Psa139:11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.
Psa139:12 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light <em>are</em> both alike <em>to thee</em>.
Psa139:13 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
Psa139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully <em>and</em> wonderfully made: marvellous <em>are</em> thy works; and <em>that</em> my soul knoweth right well.
Psa139:15 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, <em>and</em> curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
Psa139:16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all <em>my members</em> were written, <em>which</em> in continuance were fashioned, when <em>as yet there was</em> none of them.
Psa139:17 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!
Psa139:18 <em>If</em> I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.
Psa139:19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
Psa139:20 For they speak against thee wickedly, <em>and</em> thine enemies take <em>thy name</em> in vain.
Psa139:21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
Psa139:22 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
Psa139:23 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
Psa139:24 And see if <em>there be any</em> wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
Psa140:1 <<To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.>> Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;
Psa140:2 Which imagine mischiefs in <em>their</em> heart; continually are they gathered together <em>for</em> war.
Psa140:3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison <em>is</em> under their lips. Selah.
Psa140:4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.
Psa140:5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.
Psa140:6 I said unto the LORD, Thou <em>art</em> my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.
Psa140:7 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
Psa140:8 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; <em>lest</em> they exalt themselves. Selah.
Psa140:9 <em>As for</em> the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
Psa140:10 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
Psa140:11 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow <em>him</em>.
Psa140:12 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, <em>and</em> the right of the poor.
Psa140:13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
Psa141:1 <<A Psalm of David.>> LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
Psa141:2 Let my prayer be set forth before thee <em>as</em> incense; <em>and</em> the lifting up of my hands <em>as</em> the evening sacrifice.
Psa141:3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
Psa141:4 Incline not my heart to <em>any</em> evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.
Psa141:5 Let the righteous smite me; <em>it shall be</em> a kindness: and let him reprove me; <em>it shall be</em> an excellent oil, <em>which</em> shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also <em>shall be</em> in their calamities.
Psa141:6 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
Psa141:7 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth <em>wood</em> upon the earth.
Psa141:8 But mine eyes <em>are</em> unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
Psa141:9 Keep me from the snares <em>which</em> they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.
Psa141:10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
Psa142:1 <<Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave.>> I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.
Psa142:2 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.
Psa142:3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
Psa142:4 I looked on <em>my</em> right hand, and beheld, but <em>there was</em> no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.
Psa142:5 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou <em>art</em> my refuge <em>and</em> my portion in the land of the living.
Psa142:6 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
Psa142:7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
Psa143:1 <<A Psalm of David.>> Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, <em>and</em> in thy righteousness.
Psa143:2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
Psa143:3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
Psa143:4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.
Psa143:5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.
Psa143:6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul <em>thirsteth</em> after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.
Psa143:7 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
Psa143:8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.
Psa143:9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.
Psa143:10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou <em>art</em> my God: thy spirit <em>is</em> good; lead me into the land of uprightness.
Psa143:11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.
Psa143:12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I <em>am</em> thy servant.
Psa144:1 <<(A Psalm) of David.>> Blessed <em>be</em> the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, <em>and</em> my fingers to fight:
Psa144:2 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and <em>he</em> in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.
Psa144:3 LORD, what <em>is</em> man, that thou takest knowledge of him! <em>or</em> the son of man, that thou makest account of him!
Psa144:4 Man is like to vanity: his days <em>are</em> as a shadow that passeth away.
Psa144:5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
Psa144:6 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.
Psa144:7 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;
Psa144:8 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand <em>is</em> a right hand of falsehood.
Psa144:9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery <em>and</em> an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
Psa144:10 <em>It is he</em> that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
Psa144:11 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand <em>is</em> a right hand of falsehood:
Psa144:12 That our sons <em>may be</em> as plants grown up in their youth; <em>that</em> our daughters <em>may be</em> as corner stones, polished <em>after</em> the similitude of a palace:
Psa144:13 <em>That</em> our garners <em>may be</em> full, affording all manner of store: <em>that</em> our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:
Psa144:14 <em>That</em> our oxen <em>may be</em> strong to labour; <em>that there be</em> no breaking in, nor going out; that <em>there be</em> no complaining in our streets.
Psa144:15 Happy <em>is that</em> people, that is in such a case: <em>yea</em>, happy <em>is that</em> people, whose God <em>is</em> the LORD.
Psa145:1 <<David's <em>Psalm</em> of praise.>> I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
Psa145:2 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
Psa145:3 Great <em>is</em> the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness <em>is</em> unsearchable.
Psa145:4 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.
Psa145:5 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.
Psa145:6 And <em>men</em> shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness.
Psa145:7 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.
Psa145:8 The LORD <em>is</em> gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.
Psa145:9 The LORD <em>is</em> good to all: and his tender mercies <em>are</em> over all his works.
Psa145:10 All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee.
Psa145:11 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;
Psa145:12 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.
Psa145:13 Thy kingdom <em>is</em> an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion <em>endureth</em> throughout all generations.
Psa145:14 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all <em>those that be</em> bowed down.
Psa145:15 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.
Psa145:16 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
Psa145:17 The LORD <em>is</em> righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.
Psa145:18 The LORD <em>is</em> nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.
Psa145:19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
Psa145:20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.
Psa145:21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
Psa146:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
Psa146:2 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
Psa146:3 Put not your trust in princes, <em>nor</em> in the son of man, in whom <em>there is</em> no help.
Psa146:4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
Psa146:5 Happy <em>is he</em> that <em>hath</em> the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope <em>is</em> in the LORD his God:
Psa146:6 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein <em>is</em>: which keepeth truth for ever:
Psa146:7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:
Psa146:8 The LORD openeth <em>the eyes of</em> the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:
Psa146:9 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
Psa146:10 The LORD shall reign for ever, <em>even</em> thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.
Psa147:1 Praise ye the LORD: for <em>it is</em> good to sing praises unto our God; for <em>it is</em> pleasant; <em>and</em> praise is comely.
Psa147:2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.
Psa147:3 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.
Psa147:4 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by <em>their</em> names.
Psa147:5 Great <em>is</em> our Lord, and of great power: his understanding <em>is</em> infinite.
Psa147:6 The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.
Psa147:7 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:
Psa147:8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.
Psa147:9 He giveth to the beast his food, <em>and</em> to the young ravens which cry.
Psa147:10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.
Psa147:11 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.
Psa147:12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.
Psa147:13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.
Psa147:14 He maketh peace <em>in</em> thy borders, <em>and</em> filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.
Psa147:15 He sendeth forth his commandment <em>upon</em> earth: his word runneth very swiftly.
Psa147:16 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.
Psa147:17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?
Psa147:18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, <em>and</em> the waters flow.
Psa147:19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.
Psa147:20 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and <em>as for his</em> judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.
Psa148:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights.
Psa148:2 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.
Psa148:3 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.
Psa148:4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that <em>be</em> above the heavens.
Psa148:5 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.
Psa148:6 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.
Psa148:7 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:
Psa148:8 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word:
Psa148:9 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:
Psa148:10 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:
Psa148:11 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:
Psa148:12 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:
Psa148:13 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory <em>is</em> above the earth and heaven.
Psa148:14 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; <em>even</em> of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.
Psa149:1 Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, <em>and</em> his praise in the congregation of saints.
Psa149:2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
Psa149:3 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.
Psa149:4 For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.
Psa149:5 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.
Psa149:6 <em>Let</em> the high <em>praises</em> of God <em>be</em> in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand;
Psa149:7 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, <em>and</em> punishments upon the people;
Psa149:8 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;
Psa149:9 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.
Psa150:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.
Psa150:2 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.
Psa150:3 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp.
Psa150:4 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.
Psa150:5 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.
Psa150:6 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.
