Hab1:1 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
Hab1:2 O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! <em>even</em> cry out unto thee <em>of</em> violence, and thou wilt not save!
Hab1:3 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause <em>me</em> to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence <em>are</em> before me: and there are <em>that</em> raise up strife and contention.
Hab1:4 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.
Hab1:5 [[Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for <em>I</em> will work a work in your days, <em>which</em> ye will not believe, though it be told <em>you</em>.]]
Hab1:6 [[For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, <em>that</em> bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces <em>that are</em> not theirs.]]
Hab1:7 [[They <em>are</em> terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.]]
Hab1:8 [[Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle <em>that</em> hasteth to eat.]]
Hab1:9 [[They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up <em>as</em> the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.]]
Hab1:10 [[And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.]]
Hab1:11 [[Then shall <em>his</em> mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, <em>imputing</em> this his power unto his god.]]
Hab1:12 <em>Art</em> thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.
Hab1:13 <em>Thou art</em> of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, <em>and</em> holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth <em>the man that is</em> more righteous than he?
Hab1:14 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, <em>that have</em> no ruler over them?
Hab1:15 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.
Hab1:16 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion <em>is</em> fat, and their meat plenteous.
Hab1:17 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?
Hab2:1 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.
Hab2:2 And the LORD answered me, and said, [[Write the vision, and make <em>it</em> plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.]]
Hab2:3 [[For the vision <em>is</em> yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.]]
Hab2:4 [[Behold, his soul <em>which</em> is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.]]
Hab2:5 [[Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, <em>he is</em> a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and <em>is</em> as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:]]
Hab2:6 [[Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth <em>that which is</em> not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!]]
Hab2:7 [[Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?]]
Hab2:8 [[Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and <em>for</em> the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.]]
Hab2:9 [[Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!]]
Hab2:10 [[Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned <em>against</em> thy soul.]]
Hab2:11 [[For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.]]
Hab2:12 [[Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!]]
Hab2:13 [[Behold, <em>is it</em> not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?]]
Hab2:14 [[For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.]]
Hab2:15 [[Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to <em>him</em>, and makest <em>him</em> drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!]]
Hab2:16 [[Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing <em>shall be</em> on thy glory.]]
Hab2:17 [[For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, <em>which</em> made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.]]
Hab2:18 [[What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?]]
Hab2:19 [[Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it <em>is</em> laid over with gold and silver, and <em>there is</em> no breath at all in the midst of it.]]
Hab2:20 [[But the LORD <em>is</em> in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.]]
Hab3:1 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.
Hab3:2 O LORD, I have heard thy speech, <em>and</em> was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.
Hab3:3 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.
Hab3:4 And <em>his</em> brightness was as the light; he had horns <em>coming</em> out of his hand: and there <em>was</em> the hiding of his power.
Hab3:5 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.
Hab3:6 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways <em>are</em> everlasting.
Hab3:7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: <em>and</em> the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
Hab3:8 Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? <em>was</em> thine anger against the rivers? <em>was</em> thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses <em>and</em> thy chariots of salvation?
Hab3:9 Thy bow was made quite naked, <em>according</em> to the oaths of the tribes, <em>even thy</em> word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
Hab3:10 The mountains saw thee, <em>and</em> they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, <em>and</em> lifted up his hands on high.
Hab3:11 The sun <em>and</em> moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, <em>and</em> at the shining of thy glittering spear.
Hab3:12 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.
Hab3:13 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, <em>even</em> for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.
Hab3:14 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing <em>was</em> as to devour the poor secretly.
Hab3:15 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, <em>through</em> the heap of great waters.
Hab3:16 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.
Hab3:17 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither <em>shall</em> fruit <em>be</em> in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and <em>there shall be</em> no herd in the stalls:
Hab3:18 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.
Hab3:19 The LORD God <em>is</em> my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' <em>feet</em>, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.
