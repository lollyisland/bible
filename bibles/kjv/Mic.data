Mic1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, <em>and</em> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
Mic1:2 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
Mic1:3 For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.
Mic1:4 And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, <em>and</em> as the waters <em>that are</em> poured down a steep place.
Mic1:5 For the transgression of Jacob <em>is</em> all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What <em>is</em> the transgression of Jacob? <em>is it</em> not Samaria? and what <em>are</em> the high places of Judah? <em>are they</em> not Jerusalem?
Mic1:6 [[Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, <em>and</em> as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.]]
Mic1:7 [[And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered <em>it</em> of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.]]
Mic1:8 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.
Mic1:9 For her wound <em>is</em> incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, <em>even</em> to Jerusalem.
Mic1:10 Declare ye <em>it</em> not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.
Mic1:11 Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.
Mic1:12 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.
Mic1:13 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she <em>is</em> the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
Mic1:14 Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib <em>shall be</em> a lie to the kings of Israel.
Mic1:15 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.
Mic1:16 Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.
Mic2:1 Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.
Mic2:2 And they covet fields, and take <em>them</em> by violence; and houses, and take <em>them</em> away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
Mic2:3 Therefore thus saith the LORD; [[Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time <em>is</em> evil.]]
Mic2:4 [[In that day shall <em>one</em> take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, <em>and</em> say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed <em>it</em> from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.]]
Mic2:5 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.
Mic2:6 Prophesy ye not, <em>say they to them that</em> prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, <em>that</em> they shall not take shame.
Mic2:7 [[O <em>thou that art</em> named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? <em>are</em> these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?]]
Mic2:8 [[Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.]]
Mic2:9 [[The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.]]
Mic2:10 [[Arise ye, and depart; for this <em>is</em> not <em>your</em> rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy <em>you</em>, even with a sore destruction.]]
Mic2:11 [[If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, <em>saying</em>, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.]]
Mic2:12 [[I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of <em>the multitude of</em> men.]]
Mic2:13 [[The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.]]
Mic3:1 And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; <em>Is it</em> not for you to know judgment?
Mic3:2 Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
Mic3:3 Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
Mic3:4 Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.
Mic3:5 [[Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.]]
Mic3:6 [[Therefore night <em>shall be</em> unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.]]
Mic3:7 [[Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for <em>there is</em> no answer of God.]]
Mic3:8 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
Mic3:9 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.
Mic3:10 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
Mic3:11 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, <em>Is</em> not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.
Mic3:12 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed <em>as</em> a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.
Mic4:1 But in the last days it shall come to pass, <em>that</em> the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.
Mic4:2 And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
Mic4:3 And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
Mic4:4 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make <em>them</em> afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken <em>it</em>.
Mic4:5 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.
Mic4:6 [[In that day,]] saith the LORD, [[will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;]]
Mic4:7 [[And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.]]
Mic4:8 [[And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.]]
Mic4:9 Now why dost thou cry out aloud? <em>is there</em> no king in thee? is thy counseller perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.
Mic4:10 Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go <em>even</em> to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
Mic4:11 Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.
Mic4:12 But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.
Mic4:13 [[Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.]]
Mic5:1 Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
Mic5:2 [[But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, <em>though</em> thou be little among the thousands of Judah, <em>yet</em> out of thee shall he come forth unto me <em>that is</em> to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth <em>have been</em> from of old, from everlasting.]]
Mic5:3 Therefore will he give them up, until the time <em>that</em> she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.
Mic5:4 And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.
Mic5:5 And this <em>man</em> shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.
Mic5:6 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver <em>us</em> from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.
Mic5:7 And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.
Mic5:8 And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.
Mic5:9 Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.
Mic5:10 [[And it shall come to pass in that day,]] saith the LORD, [[that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:]]
Mic5:11 [[And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:]]
Mic5:12 [[And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no <em>more</em> soothsayers:]]
Mic5:13 [[Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.]]
Mic5:14 [[And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.]]
Mic5:15 [[And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.]]
Mic6:1 Hear ye now what the LORD saith; [[Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.]]
Mic6:2 [[Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.]]
Mic6:3 [[O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.]]
Mic6:4 [[For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.]]
Mic6:5 [[O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.]]
Mic6:6 Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, <em>and</em> bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?
Mic6:7 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, <em>or</em> with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn <em>for</em> my transgression, the fruit of my body <em>for</em> the sin of my soul?
Mic6:8 He hath shewed thee, O man, what <em>is</em> good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?
Mic6:9 The LORD's voice crieth unto the city, and <em>the man of</em> wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.
Mic6:10 [[Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure <em>that is</em> abominable?]]
Mic6:11 [[Shall I count <em>them</em> pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?]]
Mic6:12 [[For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue <em>is</em> deceitful in their mouth.]]
Mic6:13 [[Therefore also will I make <em>thee</em> sick in smiting thee, in making <em>thee</em> desolate because of thy sins.]]
Mic6:14 [[Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down <em>shall be</em> in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and <em>that</em> which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.]]
Mic6:15 [[Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.]]
Mic6:16 [[For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.]]
Mic7:1 Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: <em>there is</em> no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.
Mic7:2 The good <em>man</em> is perished out of the earth: and <em>there is</em> none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.
Mic7:3 That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge <em>asketh</em> for a reward; and the great <em>man</em>, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.
Mic7:4 The best of them <em>is</em> as a brier: the most upright <em>is sharper</em> than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen <em>and</em> thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.
Mic7:5 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.
Mic7:6 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies <em>are</em> the men of his own house.
Mic7:7 Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.
Mic7:8 Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD <em>shall be</em> a light unto me.
Mic7:9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, <em>and</em> I shall behold his righteousness.
Mic7:10 Then <em>she that is</em> mine enemy shall see <em>it</em>, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.
Mic7:11 <em>In</em> the day that thy walls are to be built, <em>in</em> that day shall the decree be far removed.
Mic7:12 <em>In</em> that day <em>also</em> he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and <em>from</em> the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and <em>from</em> mountain to mountain.
Mic7:13 Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.
Mic7:14 Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily <em>in</em> the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed <em>in</em> Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
Mic7:15 [[According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous <em>things</em>.]]
Mic7:16 The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay <em>their</em> hand upon <em>their</em> mouth, their ears shall be deaf.
Mic7:17 They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.
Mic7:18 Who <em>is</em> a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth <em>in</em> mercy.
Mic7:19 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
Mic7:20 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, <em>and</em> the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.
