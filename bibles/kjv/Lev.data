Lev8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Lev8:2 [[Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;]]
Lev8:3 [[And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.]]
Lev8:4 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
Lev8:5 And Moses said unto the congregation, This <em>is</em> the thing which the LORD commanded to be done.
Lev8:6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
Lev8:7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound <em>it</em> unto him therewith.
Lev8:8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.
Lev8:9 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, <em>even</em> upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Lev8:10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that <em>was</em> therein, and sanctified them.
Lev8:11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.
Lev8:12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
Lev8:13 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Lev8:14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.
Lev8:15 And he slew <em>it</em>; and Moses took the blood, and put <em>it</em> upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.
Lev8:16 And he took all the fat that <em>was</em> upon the inwards, and the caul <em>above</em> the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned <em>it</em> upon the altar.
Lev8:17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Lev8:18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
Lev8:19 And he killed <em>it</em>; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
Lev8:20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
Lev8:21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it <em>was</em> a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, <em>and</em> an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Lev8:22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
Lev8:23 And he slew <em>it</em>; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put <em>it</em> upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
Lev8:24 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
Lev8:25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that <em>was</em> upon the inwards, and the caul <em>above</em> the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:
Lev8:26 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that <em>was</em> before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put <em>them</em> on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:
Lev8:27 And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them <em>for</em> a wave offering before the LORD.
Lev8:28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt <em>them</em> on the altar upon the burnt offering: they <em>were</em> consecrations for a sweet savour: it <em>is</em> an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
Lev8:29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it <em>for</em> a wave offering before the LORD: <em>for</em> of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Lev8:30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which <em>was</em> upon the altar, and sprinkled <em>it</em> upon Aaron, <em>and</em> upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, <em>and</em> his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
Lev8:31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh <em>at</em> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that <em>is</em> in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
Lev8:32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
Lev8:33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation <em>in</em> seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.
Lev8:34 As he hath done this day, <em>so</em> the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.
Lev8:35 Therefore shall ye abide <em>at</em> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.
Lev8:36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
Lev9:1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, <em>that</em> Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
Lev9:2 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer <em>them</em> before the LORD.
Lev9:3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, <em>both</em> of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;
Lev9:4 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.
Lev9:5 And they brought <em>that</em> which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
Lev9:6 And Moses said, This <em>is</em> the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.
Lev9:7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.
Lev9:8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which <em>was</em> for himself.
Lev9:9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put <em>it</em> upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:
Lev9:10 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Lev9:11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
Lev9:12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.
Lev9:13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt <em>them</em> upon the altar.
Lev9:14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt <em>them</em> upon the burnt offering on the altar.
Lev9:15 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which <em>was</em> the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
Lev9:16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.
Lev9:17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt <em>it</em> upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.
Lev9:18 He slew also the bullock and the ram <em>for</em> a sacrifice of peace offerings, which <em>was</em> for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,
Lev9:19 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth <em>the inwards</em>, and the kidneys, and the caul <em>above</em> the liver:
Lev9:20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:
Lev9:21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved <em>for</em> a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.
Lev9:22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.
Lev9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.
Lev9:24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: <em>which</em> when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
Lev10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.
Lev10:2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.
Lev10:3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This <em>is it</em> that the LORD spake, saying, [[I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified.]] And Aaron held his peace.
Lev10:4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
Lev10:5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.
Lev10:6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.
Lev10:7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD <em>is</em> upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
Lev10:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,
Lev10:9 [[Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: <em>it shall be</em> a statute for ever throughout your generations:]]
Lev10:10 [[And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;]]
Lev10:11 [[And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.]]
Lev10:12 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it <em>is</em> most holy:
Lev10:13 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it <em>is</em> thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.
Lev10:14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for <em>they be</em> thy due, and thy sons' due, <em>which</em> are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.
Lev10:15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave <em>it for</em> a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.
Lev10:16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron <em>which were</em> left <em>alive</em>, saying,
Lev10:17 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it <em>is</em> most holy, and <em>God</em> hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?
Lev10:18 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy <em>place</em>: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy <em>place</em>, as I commanded.
Lev10:19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and <em>if</em> I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?
Lev10:20 And when Moses heard <em>that</em>, he was content.
Lev11:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
Lev11:2 [[Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These <em>are</em> the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that <em>are</em> on the earth.]]
Lev11:3 [[Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, <em>and</em> cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.]]
Lev11:4 [[Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: <em>as</em> the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <em>is</em> unclean unto you.]]
Lev11:5 [[And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <em>is</em> unclean unto you.]]
Lev11:6 [[And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <em>is</em> unclean unto you.]]
Lev11:7 [[And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he <em>is</em> unclean to you.]]
Lev11:8 [[Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they <em>are</em> unclean to you.]]
Lev11:9 [[These shall ye eat of all that <em>are</em> in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.]]
Lev11:10 [[And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which <em>is</em> in the waters, they <em>shall be</em> an abomination unto you:]]
Lev11:11 [[They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.]]
Lev11:12 [[Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that <em>shall be</em> an abomination unto you.]]
Lev11:13 [[And these <em>are they which</em> ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they <em>are</em> an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,]]
Lev11:14 [[And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;]]
Lev11:15 [[Every raven after his kind;]]
Lev11:16 [[And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,]]
Lev11:17 [[And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,]]
Lev11:18 [[And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,]]
Lev11:19 [[And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.]]
Lev11:20 [[All fowls that creep, going upon <em>all</em> four, <em>shall be</em> an abomination unto you.]]
Lev11:21 [[Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon <em>all</em> four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;]]
Lev11:22 [[<em>Even</em> these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.]]
Lev11:23 [[But all <em>other</em> flying creeping things, which have four feet, <em>shall be</em> an abomination unto you.]]
Lev11:24 [[And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.]]
Lev11:25 [[And whosoever beareth <em>ought</em> of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.]]
Lev11:26 [[<em>The carcases</em> of every beast which divideth the hoof, and <em>is</em> not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, <em>are</em> unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.]]
Lev11:27 [[And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on <em>all</em> four, those <em>are</em> unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.]]
Lev11:28 [[And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they <em>are</em> unclean unto you.]]
Lev11:29 [[These also <em>shall be</em> unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,]]
Lev11:30 [[And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.]]
Lev11:31 [[These <em>are</em> unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.]]
Lev11:32 [[And upon whatsoever <em>any</em> of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether <em>it be</em> any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel <em>it be</em>, wherein <em>any</em> work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.]]
Lev11:33 [[And every earthen vessel, whereinto <em>any</em> of them falleth, whatsoever <em>is</em> in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.]]
Lev11:34 [[Of all meat which may be eaten, <em>that</em> on which <em>such</em> water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every <em>such</em> vessel shall be unclean.]]
Lev11:35 [[And every <em>thing</em> whereupon <em>any part</em> of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; <em>whether it be</em> oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: <em>for</em> they <em>are</em> unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.]]
Lev11:36 [[Nevertheless a fountain or pit, <em>wherein there is</em> plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.]]
Lev11:37 [[And if <em>any part</em> of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it <em>shall be</em> clean.]]
Lev11:38 [[But if <em>any</em> water be put upon the seed, and <em>any part</em> of their carcase fall thereon, it <em>shall be</em> unclean unto you.]]
Lev11:39 [[And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.]]

Lev11:42 [[Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon <em>all</em> four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they <em>are</em> an abomination.]]
Lev11:43 [[Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.]]
Lev11:44 [[For I <em>am</em> the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I <em>am</em> holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.]]
Lev11:45 [[For I <em>am</em> the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I <em>am</em> holy.]]
Lev11:46 [[This <em>is</em> the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:]]
Lev11:47 [[To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.]]
Lev12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Lev12:2 [[Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.]]
Lev12:3 [[And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.]]
Lev12:4 [[And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.]]
Lev12:5 [[But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.]]
Lev12:6 [[And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:]]
Lev12:7 [[Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This <em>is</em> the law for her that hath born a male or a female.]]
Lev12:8 [[And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.]]
Lev13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,
Lev13:2 [[When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh <em>like</em> the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:]]
Lev13:3 [[And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and <em>when</em> the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight <em>be</em> deeper than the skin of his flesh, it <em>is</em> a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.]]
Lev13:4 [[If the bright spot <em>be</em> white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight <em>be</em> not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up <em>him that hath</em> the plague seven days:]]
Lev13:5 [[And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, <em>if</em> the plague in his sight be at a stay, <em>and</em> the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:]]
Lev13:6 [[And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, <em>if</em> the plague <em>be</em> somewhat dark, <em>and</em> the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it <em>is but</em> a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.]]
Lev13:7 [[But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:]]
Lev13:8 [[And <em>if</em> the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <em>is</em> a leprosy.]]
Lev13:9 [[When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;]]
Lev13:10 [[And the priest shall see <em>him</em>: and, behold, <em>if</em> the rising <em>be</em> white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and <em>there be</em> quick raw flesh in the rising;]]
Lev13:11 [[It <em>is</em> an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he <em>is</em> unclean.]]
Lev13:12 [[And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of <em>him that hath</em> the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;]]
Lev13:13 [[Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, <em>if</em> the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce <em>him</em> clean <em>that hath</em> the plague: it is all turned white: he <em>is</em> clean.]]
Lev13:14 [[But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.]]
Lev13:15 [[And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: <em>for</em> the raw flesh <em>is</em> unclean: it <em>is</em> a leprosy.]]
Lev13:16 [[Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;]]
Lev13:17 [[And the priest shall see him: and, behold, <em>if</em> the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce <em>him</em> clean <em>that hath</em> the plague: he <em>is</em> clean.]]
Lev13:18 [[The flesh also, in which, <em>even</em> in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,]]
Lev13:19 [[And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;]]
Lev13:20 [[And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it <em>be</em> in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <em>is</em> a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.]]
Lev13:21 [[But if the priest look on it, and, behold, <em>there be</em> no white hairs therein, and <em>if</em> it <em>be</em> not lower than the skin, but <em>be</em> somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:]]
Lev13:22 [[And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <em>is</em> a plague.]]
Lev13:23 [[But if the bright spot stay in his place, <em>and</em> spread not, it <em>is</em> a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.]]
Lev13:24 [[Or if there be <em>any</em> flesh, in the skin whereof <em>there is</em> a hot burning, and the quick <em>flesh</em> that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;]]
Lev13:25 [[Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, <em>if</em> the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it <em>be in</em> sight deeper than the skin; it <em>is</em> a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <em>is</em> the plague of leprosy.]]
Lev13:26 [[But if the priest look on it, and, behold, <em>there be</em> no white hair in the bright spot, and it <em>be</em> no lower than the <em>other</em> skin, but <em>be</em> somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:]]
Lev13:27 [[And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: <em>and</em> if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <em>is</em> the plague of leprosy.]]
Lev13:28 [[And if the bright spot stay in his place, <em>and</em> spread not in the skin, but it <em>be</em> somewhat dark; it <em>is</em> a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it <em>is</em> an inflammation of the burning.]]
Lev13:29 [[If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;]]
Lev13:30 [[Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it <em>be</em> in sight deeper than the skin; <em>and there be</em> in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <em>is</em> a dry scall, <em>even</em> a leprosy upon the head or beard.]]
Lev13:31 [[And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it <em>be</em> not in sight deeper than the skin, and <em>that there is</em> no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up <em>him that hath</em> the plague of the scall seven days:]]
Lev13:32 [[And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, <em>if</em> the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall <em>be</em> not in sight deeper than the skin;]]
Lev13:33 [[He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up <em>him that hath</em> the scall seven days more:]]
Lev13:34 [[And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, <em>if</em> the scall be not spread in the skin, nor <em>be</em> in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.]]
Lev13:35 [[But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;]]
Lev13:36 [[Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he <em>is</em> unclean.]]
Lev13:37 [[But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and <em>that</em> there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he <em>is</em> clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.]]
Lev13:38 [[If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, <em>even</em> white bright spots;]]
Lev13:39 [[Then the priest shall look: and, behold, <em>if</em> the bright spots in the skin of their flesh <em>be</em> darkish white; it <em>is</em> a freckled spot <em>that</em> groweth in the skin; he <em>is</em> clean.]]
Lev13:40 [[And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he <em>is</em> bald; <em>yet is</em> he clean.]]

Lev24:2 [[Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.]]
Lev24:3 [[Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: <em>it shall be</em> a statute for ever in your generations.]]
Lev24:4 [[He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.]]
Lev24:5 [[And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.]]
Lev24:6 [[And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD.]]
Lev24:7 [[And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon <em>each</em> row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, <em>even</em> an offering made by fire unto the LORD.]]
Lev24:8 [[Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, <em>being taken</em> from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.]]
Lev24:9 [[And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it <em>is</em> most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.]]
Lev24:10 [[And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father <em>was</em> an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish <em>woman</em> and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;]]
Lev24:11 [[And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name <em>of the LORD</em>, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name <em>was</em> Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)]]
Lev24:12 [[And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.]]
Lev24:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Lev24:14 [[Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard <em>him</em> lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.]]
Lev24:15 [[And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.]]
Lev24:16 [[And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, <em>and</em> all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name <em>of the LORD</em>, shall be put to death.]]
Lev24:17 [[And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.]]
Lev24:18 [[And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.]]
Lev24:19 [[And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;]]
Lev24:20 [[Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him <em>again</em>.]]
Lev24:21 [[And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.]]
Lev24:22 [[Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I <em>am</em> the LORD your God.]]
Lev24:23 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.
Lev25:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,
Lev25:2 [[Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.]]
Lev25:3 [[Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;]]
Lev25:4 [[But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.]]
Lev25:5 [[That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: <em>for</em> it is a year of rest unto the land.]]
Lev25:6 [[And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,]]
Lev25:7 [[And for thy cattle, and for the beast that <em>are</em> in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.]]
Lev25:8 [[And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.]]
Lev25:9 [[Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth <em>day</em> of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.]]
Lev25:10 [[And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout <em>all</em> the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.]]
Lev25:11 [[A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather <em>the grapes</em> in it of thy vine undressed.]]
Lev25:12 [[For it <em>is</em> the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.]]
Lev25:13 [[In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.]]
Lev25:14 [[And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest <em>ought</em> of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:]]
Lev25:15 [[According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, <em>and</em> according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:]]
Lev25:16 [[According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for <em>according</em> to the number <em>of the years</em> of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.]]
Lev25:17 [[Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I <em>am</em> the LORD your God.]]
Lev25:18 [[Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.]]
Lev25:19 [[And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.]]
Lev25:20 [[And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:]]
Lev25:21 [[Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.]]
Lev25:22 [[And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat <em>yet</em> of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat <em>of</em> the old <em>store</em>.]]
Lev25:23 [[The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land <em>is</em> mine; for ye <em>are</em> strangers and sojourners with me.]]
Lev25:24 [[And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.]]
Lev25:25 [[If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away <em>some</em> of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.]]
Lev25:26 [[And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;]]
Lev25:27 [[Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.]]
Lev25:28 [[But if he be not able to restore <em>it</em> to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.]]
Lev25:29 [[And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; <em>within</em> a full year may he redeem it.]]
Lev25:30 [[And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that <em>is</em> in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.]]
Lev25:31 [[But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.]]
Lev25:32 [[Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, <em>and</em> the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.]]
Lev25:33 [[And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in <em>the year of</em> jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites <em>are</em> their possession among the children of Israel.]]
Lev25:34 [[But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it <em>is</em> their perpetual possession.]]
Lev25:35 [[And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: <em>yea, though he be</em> a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.]]
Lev25:36 [[Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.]]
Lev25:37 [[Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.]]
Lev25:38 [[I <em>am</em> the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, <em>and</em> to be your God.]]
Lev25:39 [[And if thy brother <em>that dwelleth</em> by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:]]
Lev25:40 [[<em>But</em> as an hired servant, <em>and</em> as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, <em>and</em> shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:]]
Lev25:41 [[And <em>then</em> shall he depart from thee, <em>both</em> he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.]]
Lev25:42 [[For they <em>are</em> my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.]]
Lev25:43 [[Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.]]
Lev25:44 [[Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, <em>shall be</em> of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.]]
Lev25:45 [[Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that <em>are</em> with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.]]
Lev25:46 [[And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit <em>them for</em> a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.]]
Lev25:47 [[And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother <em>that dwelleth</em> by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger <em>or</em> sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:]]
Lev25:48 [[After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:]]
Lev25:49 [[Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or <em>any</em> that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.]]
Lev25:50 [[And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.]]
Lev25:51 [[If <em>there be</em> yet many years <em>behind</em>, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.]]
Lev25:52 [[And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, <em>and</em> according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.]]
Lev25:53 [[<em>And</em> as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: <em>and the other</em> shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.]]
Lev25:54 [[And if he be not redeemed in these <em>years</em>, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, <em>both</em> he, and his children with him.]]
Lev25:55 [[For unto me the children of Israel <em>are</em> servants; they <em>are</em> my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I <em>am</em> the LORD your God.]]
Lev26:1 [[Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up <em>any</em> image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I <em>am</em> the LORD your God.]]
Lev26:2 [[Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I <em>am</em> the LORD.]]
Lev26:3 [[If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;]]
Lev26:4 [[Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.]]
Lev26:5 [[And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.]]
Lev26:6 [[And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make <em>you</em> afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.]]
Lev26:7 [[And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.]]
Lev26:8 [[And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.]]
Lev26:9 [[For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.]]
Lev26:10 [[And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.]]
Lev26:11 [[And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.]]
Lev26:12 [[And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.]]
Lev26:13 [[I <em>am</em> the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.]]
Lev26:14 [[But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;]]
Lev26:15 [[And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, <em>but</em> that ye break my covenant:]]
Lev26:16 [[I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.]]
Lev26:17 [[And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.]]
Lev26:18 [[And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.]]
Lev26:19 [[And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:]]
Lev26:20 [[And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.]]
Lev26:21 [[And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.]]
Lev26:22 [[I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your <em>high</em> ways shall be desolate.]]
Lev26:23 [[And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;]]
Lev26:24 [[Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.]]
Lev26:25 [[And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of <em>my</em> covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.]]
Lev26:26 [[<em>And</em> when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver <em>you</em> your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.]]
Lev26:27 [[And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;]]
Lev26:28 [[Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.]]
Lev26:29 [[And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.]]
Lev26:30 [[And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.]]
Lev26:31 [[And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.]]
Lev26:32 [[And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.]]
Lev26:33 [[And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.]]
Lev26:34 [[Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye <em>be</em> in your enemies' land; <em>even</em> then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.]]
Lev26:35 [[As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.]]
Lev26:36 [[And upon them that are left <em>alive</em> of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.]]
Lev26:37 [[And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.]]
Lev26:38 [[And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.]]
Lev26:39 [[And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.]]
Lev26:40 [[If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;]]
Lev26:41 [[And <em>that</em> I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:]]
Lev26:42 [[Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.]]
Lev26:43 [[The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.]]
Lev26:44 [[And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I <em>am</em> the LORD their God.]]
Lev26:45 [[But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I <em>am</em> the LORD.]]
Lev26:46 These <em>are</em> the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
Lev27:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Lev27:2 [[Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons <em>shall be</em> for the LORD by thy estimation.]]
Lev27:3 [[And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.]]
Lev27:4 [[And if it <em>be</em> a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.]]
Lev27:5 [[And if <em>it be</em> from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.]]
Lev27:6 [[And if <em>it be</em> from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation <em>shall be</em> three shekels of silver.]]
Lev27:7 [[And if <em>it be</em> from sixty years old and above; if <em>it be</em> a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.]]
Lev27:8 [[But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.]]
Lev27:9 [[And if <em>it be</em> a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that <em>any man</em> giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.]]
Lev27:10 [[He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.]]
Lev27:11 [[And if <em>it be</em> any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:]]
Lev27:12 [[And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, <em>who art</em> the priest, so shall it be.]]
Lev27:13 [[But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth <em>part</em> thereof unto thy estimation.]]
Lev27:14 [[And when a man shall sanctify his house <em>to be</em> holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.]]
Lev27:15 [[And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth <em>part</em> of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.]]
Lev27:16 [[And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD <em>some part</em> of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed <em>shall be valued</em> at fifty shekels of silver.]]
Lev27:17 [[If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.]]
Lev27:18 [[But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.]]
Lev27:19 [[And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth <em>part</em> of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.]]
Lev27:20 [[And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.]]
Lev27:21 [[But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.]]
Lev27:22 [[And if <em>a man</em> sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which <em>is</em> not of the fields of his possession;]]
Lev27:23 [[Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, <em>even</em> unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, <em>as</em> a holy thing unto the LORD.]]
Lev27:24 [[In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, <em>even</em> to him to whom the possession of the land <em>did belong</em>.]]
Lev27:25 [[And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.]]
Lev27:26 [[Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether <em>it be</em> ox, or sheep: it <em>is</em> the LORD's.]]
Lev27:27 [[And if <em>it be</em> of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem <em>it</em> according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth <em>part</em> of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.]]
Lev27:28 [[Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, <em>both</em> of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing <em>is</em> most holy unto the LORD.]]
Lev27:29 [[None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; <em>but</em> shall surely be put to death.]]
Lev27:30 [[And all the tithe of the land, <em>whether</em> of the seed of the land, <em>or</em> of the fruit of the tree, <em>is</em> the LORD's: <em>it is</em> holy unto the LORD.]]
Lev27:31 [[And if a man will at all redeem <em>ought</em> of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth <em>part</em> thereof.]]
Lev27:32 [[And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, <em>even</em> of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.]]
Lev27:33 [[He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.]]
Lev27:34 These <em>are</em> the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
